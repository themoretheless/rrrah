# bunlock-dedupe

`bunlock-dedupe` finds and fixes duplicate package versions in your `bun.lock` file.

## Usage

Run in any directory with a `bun.lock` file:

```bash
bunx bunlock-dedupe                     # show fixable duplicates
bunx bunlock-dedupe --all               # show all duplicates, including unfixable
bunx bunlock-dedupe --fix               # rewrite the lockfile
bunx bunlock-dedupe --update            # find updates that unlock deduplication
bunx bunlock-dedupe --update --fix      # apply those updates and dedupe
bunx bunlock-dedupe --update --refresh  # revalidate cached registry data
bunx bunlock-dedupe --update --offline  # analyze using only the local bun cache
bunx bunlock-dedupe --repair            # find lost dependency ranges
bunx bunlock-dedupe --repair --fix      # restore published dependency metadata
```

Or pass a path to a lockfile or project directory:

```bash
bunx bunlock-dedupe /path/to/bun.lock
bunx bunlock-dedupe /path/to/bun.lock --fix
```

After `--fix`, run `bun install` once to let Bun normalize canonical lockfile key placement.
This extra rewrite is expected for now; see GitHub issue [Match Bun canonical key placement
](https://github.com/IlyaSemenov/bunlock-dedupe/issues/10).

## What each mode does

**No flags** — scans the lockfile and shows packages where deduplication is possible. Marks the version that will be kept (`✅`), the versions that can be upgraded to it (`⬆️`), and orphan versions (`🗑️`) that will be removed when the parent is deduped.

**`--all`** — also shows packages that cannot be deduped (marked `❌`), for the full picture.

**`--fix`** — rewrites the lockfile, upgrading every dedupe-compatible version to the highest version that all their semver ranges allow.

**`--update`** — scans for intermediate dependencies that block deduplication and checks the npm registry for newer compatible versions that would unlock it.
Use `--update --fix` to apply suggested lockfile updates and dedupe the unlocked entries.
Use `--offline` to analyze only the local bun cache instead of the registry. `--offline --fix` is intentionally rejected because Bun's package cache does not include registry integrity metadata needed to safely write updated lockfile entries.

**`--repair`** — checks the locked package versions against the npm registry and shows dependency metadata that can be restored.
Use `--repair --fix` to write the repairs.
Repair runs separately from deduplication and updates; it cannot be combined with `--all`, `--update`, or `--offline`.

## Output explained

Each duplicate package is listed with its versions. Here is what every status means:

```text
typescript:
  ✅ 5.8.3
    used by:
      - myapp: ^5.8.0
  ⬆️ 5.6.2 → 5.8.3
    used by:
      - myapp > ts-jest: ^5.6.0

react:
  ✅ 19.1.0
    used by:
      - myapp: ^19.0.0
  ❌ 18.3.1
    blocked by:
      - myapp > react-pdf: ^18.0.0
    also used by:
      - myapp > react-inspector: >=18.0.0

@types/node:
  ✅ 22.13.0
    used by:
      - myapp: ^22.0.0
  ⬆️ 20.18.0 → 22.13.0
    used by:
      - myapp > bun-types: *

undici-types:
  ✅ 7.16.0
    used by:
      - myapp > @types/node: ~7.16.0
  🗑️ 5.28.5
    used by:
      - myapp > bun-types > @types/node: ~5.26.0
    removed after:
      - @types/node: 20.18.0 → 22.13.0
```

| Icon | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| ✅ | **Target** — the version that will be kept |
| ⬆️ | **Can dedupe** — can be upgraded to the target; `--fix` will do this automatically |
| ❌ | **Cannot dedupe** — requires a version incompatible with the target; needs manual resolution |
| 🗑️ | **Orphan** — will become unreachable after the package listed in `removed after` is deduped, updated, or removed; no action needed |
| ✋ | **Manual update** — an intermediate package update could remove this version, but `--update --fix` cannot safely apply it automatically |
| ❓ | **Unknown** — uses a non-semver range (e.g. `catalog:`, `workspace:`) that cannot be checked automatically |

## How deduplication works

Bun sometimes resolves the same package at multiple versions because different packages declare different version ranges — even ranges that could be satisfied by the same version.

For example, if package A requires `^3.15.2` and package B requires `^3.17.0`, both ranges are compatible with `3.17.0`. `--fix` upgrades the `^3.15.2` entry to `3.17.0`, removing the duplicate.

## Range handling

- Standard semver rules are used, including prerelease handling.
- Bun overrides and resolutions recorded in `bun.lock` are respected.
- Non-semver ranges such as `catalog:`, `workspace:`, `link:`, and `file:` are reported as unknown and left unchanged.

## Finding updates that unlock deduplication

When an intermediate dependency pins a subdependency to an older version (marked `❌ cannot-dedupe`), `--update` checks the npm registry for newer versions of that intermediate package that could break the deadlock.

```bash
bunlock-dedupe --update
```

```text
shared-dep:
  ✅ 2.1.0
    used by:
      - myapp: ^2.0.0
  🗑️ 1.5.0
    used by:
      - myapp > app-blocking: ^1.0.0
    removed after:
      - app-blocking: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0

1 duplicate package in /project/bun.lock.
1 intermediate package can be updated to unlock deduplication.

Run with --update --fix to update intermediate packages and apply dedupes.
```

Update suggestions are shown inline under the duplicate version they would remove.
If an update is found but cannot be safely applied by `--update --fix`, the duplicate version is marked `✋` and lists the manual update that would remove it, along with the inbound ranges that constrain the update and the reason it cannot be applied automatically:

```text
shared-dep:
  ✋ 1.5.0 → 2.1.0
    used by:
      - myapp > app-blocking: ^1.0.0
    can be removed after manual update:
      - app-blocking: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
        required by:
          - myapp: ^1.0.0
          - myapp > other-dep: ^1.2.0
        held back: update adds dependencies missing from the lockfile
```

An update is only suggested when it would actually remove a duplicate version: if another package keeps that version pinned and has no usable update of its own, no update is offered.

## Repairing lost dependency metadata

A lockfile may record an exact version such as `1.2.3` where a dependency actually accepts a range like `^1.2.0`, blocking deduplication or updates.
For example, this can happen when migrating from pnpm.

```bash
bunlock-dedupe --repair
bunlock-dedupe --repair --fix
```

Repair restores dependency ranges and optional peers from the npm registry without changing package versions.
It skips patched packages, entries it cannot verify, and repairs requiring dependencies missing from the lockfile.
If restored ranges conflict with locked versions, the report lists them for you to resolve separately.

## Registry cache

The persistent cache is created when `--repair` or `--update` runs.
Registry responses are cached for 5 minutes in the system cache directory and revalidated afterward.
Use `--refresh` to revalidate them immediately.
Set `BUNLOCK_DEDUPE_CACHE` to a non-negative integer in seconds to override.

Cache locations are:

- macOS: `~/Library/Caches/bunlock-dedupe/registry-v1`
- Linux: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/bunlock-dedupe/registry-v1` or `~/.cache/bunlock-dedupe/registry-v1`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\bunlock-dedupe\Cache\registry-v1`

To remove all persistent data created by `bunlock-dedupe`, run:

```bash
bunx bunlock-dedupe --clear-cache
```

This removes only the registry cache shown above and does not modify any project files or Bun's own package cache.
