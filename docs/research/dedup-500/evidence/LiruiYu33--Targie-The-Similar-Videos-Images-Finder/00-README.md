> **macOS only.** Targie is a native macOS 14+ application. There is no Windows or Linux build, and none is planned.

Targie finds similar videos and images across selected folders by combining metadata, content hashes, perceptual fingerprints, and visual features.

## Features

- Switches between Videos, Images, and All scan modes and remembers the selected mode.
- Adds multiple folders through the picker or Finder drag and drop, then compares media across all selected folders.
- Recursively scans common video formats plus JPEG, PNG, HEIC, HEIF, WebP, TIFF, GIF, and BMP images.
- Uses SHA-256, cached perceptual fingerprints, metadata, and reusable Vision features while isolating unreadable files.
- Keeps video and image groups separate for side-by-side review with static in-app previews.
- Opens videos in the default player and reveals either media type in Finder.
- Supports explicit multi-selection and partial-success batch deletion.
- Requires an explicit choice between moving files to Trash and permanent deletion, with a second confirmation for permanent deletion.
- Supports English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean with instant switching and remembered preference.
- **Browse mode**: view all files from selected folders in a sortable, filterable table with drag-to-resize columns, batch selection, and a live-updating window title.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `Targie-v*.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/LiruiYu33/Targie-The-Similar-Videos-Images-Finder/releases).
2. Extract the zip and drag **Targie.app** to your Applications folder (or anywhere you prefer).
3. The app is ad-hoc signed. On first launch macOS Gatekeeper will block it:
   - **Right-click** (or Control-click) the app → **Open** → click **Open** in the dialog.
   - Alternatively, go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to the bottom, and click **Allow Anyway** next to the Targie entry, then open the app normally.
   - You only need to do this once. After the first successful launch Gatekeeper won't block it again.

## Build (macOS only)

```bash
swift test
./script/build_app.sh
```

The generated application is located at:

```text
dist/Targie.app
```

For development, build and launch with:

```bash
./script/build_and_run.sh
```

The app is ad-hoc signed for local use. Distribution through the internet or the App Store requires a Developer ID, notarization, and the appropriate packaging workflow.
