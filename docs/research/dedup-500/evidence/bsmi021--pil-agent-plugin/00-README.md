# pil-agent-plugin

An agent plugin that gives coding agents **quantitative** image measurement —
exact colour palettes, per-hue census, layout statistics, perceptual hashes, and
changed-region localisation — plus an optional constrained multi-view layer for
template-mesh fitting, Blender BVH clearance, and arbitrary matched renders.

It is designed to *complement* an agent's native multimodal vision, not replace it.

**New in 0.10.0:** a second plugin, [`blender-inspect`](plugins/blender-inspect/README.md),
now owns the Blender tools (depth, mesh-defect audit, inspection renders), and
this plugin gains `pil_depth` for model-inferred depth of concept images. The
`pil_blender_*` and `pil_multiview_render` copies here are deprecated.
**0.9.6:** every environment setting is read by its literal name.
**0.9.5:** clearer embedding-model settings and skill discovery text.
**0.9.4:** the plugin tree no longer bundles working evidence under
`runs/`, so it is smaller and fully readable. **0.9.3** added credential isolation
for MCP tools and public dependency installs. **0.9.2** added submission privacy disclosures, a bundled Codex icon,
and explicit data-handling documentation. **0.9.1** added shorter, more
discriminating skill descriptions and
progressive-disclosure entrypoints tuned for GPT-6 Astra. The 0.9.0 release
added explicit EXIF/ICC normalization, image-bound masks,
bounded registration, source-disjoint domain calibration, native local changes,
and discoverable CLI/MCP tools. See the complete
[measurement workflows and usage guide](docs/measurement-workflows.md).

## Two plugins

This repository is a marketplace with two plugins:

| Plugin | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `pil-agent-plugin` (0.10.0) | repository root | Image measurement: palettes, structure, regions, OCR, embeddings, concept-image depth (`pil_depth`), multi-view reconstruction |
| `blender-inspect` (0.1.0) | [`plugins/blender-inspect/`](plugins/blender-inspect/README.md) | Blender scenes: mesh stats, mesh-defect audit, depth-revealing render modes, which-part-is-in-front, clearance fit, matched renders |

Blender work belongs to `blender-inspect`. The Blender tools that started here
(`pil_blender_mesh`, `pil_blender_fit`, `pil_blender_render`,
`pil_multiview_render`) are **deprecated** in 0.10.0: flagged in docs and in
the capability catalog, and removed in the next minor release. They behave as
before, except that `pil_multiview_render` now places its cameras correctly
(the same fix as `blender_multiview_render`), so its renders change.
`pil_contract_verdict --scene-stats` accepts `blender_mesh` output as well as
`pil_blender_mesh` output. Evals for `blender-inspect` are not shipped.

## Privacy and data sent

Image and mesh processing runs locally. The plugin has no telemetry, hosted
processing service, or account/API-key requirement. Reports may contain local
paths, image metadata, OCR text, and measurements. The optional MCP adapter sends
tool results over local stdio to your agent; that agent may forward results or
images to its model provider under its own privacy settings.

The adapter passes only an allowlisted environment to local tool processes, so
credentials from the host are not forwarded. The plugin does not use npm.

Installation and bootstrap can contact package registries and download hosts
through uv/pip and system package managers. These services receive normal
download requests (including your IP address and requested packages), not input
images. The optional schema-validation example downloads a public schema.
Model weights must be supplied separately. See [Privacy policy](PRIVACY.md).

The Codex manifest includes a bundled [icon](assets/icon.svg) and a privacy-policy
URL. This package uses no `npx` or `uvx` launchers, so launcher version pinning is
not applicable. Python dependency resolutions are recorded in `uv.lock`.

## Why this exists

An agent with multimodal vision already reads images well: it transcribes text,
understands layout semantically, identifies objects, and recognises visual style.
What it cannot do is produce a **number** — an exact hex value, a reproducible
similarity score, or coordinates of what changed between two renders.

This was validated rather than assumed. Two subagents analysed the same complex
image; one was restricted to native vision, the other was permitted Pillow
scripting. The result was that **neither approach is a superset of the other**:

- Native vision, unassisted, produced a full text transcription, semantic layout,
  object inventory, correct style identification, *and* a correct reading of the
  image's colour-coded semantics.
- Naive measurement got one of those things **wrong**: a global 8-colour
  quantisation of the image returned *zero vivid colours*, because ~75% of its
  pixels were near-black and area-weighted extraction spent its whole budget on
  dark tones. Vision's qualitative read was right where the measurement was wrong.

So the tools here are shaped around that failure. Full write-up:
[`docs/design-rationale.md`](docs/design-rationale.md).

## Standards conformance

This package conforms to **[Agent Plugins 1.0.0](https://agent-plugins.org/specification)**,
the vendor-neutral standard for packaging reusable agent components, and ships the
portable and Claude Code-native layouts side by side:

| Path | Role | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `plugin.json` | Portable manifest, `$schema` pinned to [`schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json`](https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json) | Any Agent Plugins client |
| `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` | Codex-native manifest and interface metadata | Codex |
| `skills/image-measurement/SKILL.md` | Portable skill, per the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification) | Any Agent Plugins client |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Claude Code's native manifest | Claude Code |
| `agents/` | Claude Code subagent — no portable equivalent in 1.0.0 | Claude Code |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Single-plugin marketplace, so the CLI can install this repo; declares Claude Code's own `$schema` | Claude Code |

All four manifests describe the same package. `agents/`, `.codex-plugin/`, and `.claude-plugin/` are
undefined top-level directories under Agent Plugins, which the specification
requires clients to ignore rather than reject, so their presence does not affect
portability. The optional `scripts/pil_mcp.py` stdio adapter exposes the CLI
tools through MCP. It requires the `mcp` extra and explicit host configuration;
no root MCP configuration auto-enables it for core-only installs. See
[MCP setup](docs/measurement-workflows.md#optional-mcp-server).

Two honest limits on that claim:

- **Claude Code does not itself parse the portable manifest.** It installs from
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. The root `plugin.json` exists so that Agent Plugins
  clients and tooling can consume the same checkout; it is additive, and both
  `claude plugin validate --strict` and schema validation of `plugin.json` pass.
- **`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in the skill is client-specific.** Agent Plugins names
  the equivalent variable `${PLUGIN_ROOT}`; `SKILL.md` states both.

Conformance is enforced by [`tests/test_packaging_conformance.py`](tests/test_packaging_conformance.py),
which checks the closed manifest schema, the name patterns, skill discovery at the
fixed location, the Agent Skills frontmatter constraints, and that the three
manifests have not drifted apart — version now lives in all of them, and
`claude plugin tag` refuses a release when they disagree. To re-check the manifest against the published
schema directly:

```bash
uv run --with jsonschema python -c "
import json, urllib.request
from jsonschema import Draft202012Validator
schema = json.load(urllib.request.urlopen('https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json'))
Draft202012Validator(schema).validate(json.load(open('plugin.json')))
print('valid')"
```

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** (for plugin installation; the scripts also run standalone)
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Pillow** and **numpy** for the core image tools
- Optional reconstruction extra: **OpenCV** and **SciPy**
- Optional embedding extra: **onnxruntime** plus an ONNX vision model file —
  `uv sync --extra embedding`, then point `PIL_AGENT_EMBED_MODEL` (or
  `pil_embed --model`) at one of the two gate-tested models, pairing each with
  its preprocessing profile (`--preprocessing` / `$PIL_AGENT_EMBED_PREPROCESSING`):
  - `mobilenetv2-12.onnx` (ONNX Model Zoo) with `imagenet` — sha256
    `c0c3f76d93fa3fd6580652a45618618a220fced18babf65774ed169de0432ad5`
  - `clip-vit-b32-visual.onnx` (CLIP ViT-B/32 visual tower, ONNX export from
    jina-ai/clip-as-service) with `clip` — sha256
    `06395063c0a5c28b1a8d4bd585261501a878c8f52d1216db6c4cbb651f7c13f1`

  Model weights are pinned by hash in every payload, never bundled in this repo.
- Optional depth model for `pil_depth` (same `embedding` extra, so onnxruntime):
  an ONNX export of **Depth Anything V2 Small**, supplied by you with
  `PIL_AGENT_DEPTH_MODEL` (or `pil_depth --model`). See
  [Concept-image depth](#concept-image-depth-pil_depth) for how to obtain it and
  its licence.
  Any other model runs, but is flagged `model_not_gated` and advertises nothing.
- Optional OCR tool: a system **tesseract** binary (e.g. `apt-get install tesseract-ocr`)
- Optional Blender tools: a local Blender executable (tested with Blender 5.2)
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** recommended, for a pinned environment

## Installation

### Bootstrap

With **Python 3.11+** installed, the standalone bootstrap creates or repairs
the plugin's `.venv` and records successful setup. It runs from any working
directory; paths below assume you are at the plugin root:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell (py -3 must select Python 3.11 or newer)
py -3 .\scripts\pil_bootstrap.py check
py -3 .\scripts\pil_bootstrap.py install
py -3 .\scripts\pil_bootstrap.py check
# Optional capabilities, selected explicitly:
py -3 .\scripts\pil_bootstrap.py install --ocr --reconstruction
py -3 .\scripts\pil_bootstrap.py install --embedding --model 'C:\Models\mobilenetv2-12.onnx' --preprocessing imagenet
py -3 .\scripts\pil_bootstrap.py install --depth --depth-model 'C:\Models\depth_anything_v2_vits.onnx'
```

```sh
# macOS / Linux
python3 ./scripts/pil_bootstrap.py check
python3 ./scripts/pil_bootstrap.py install
python3 ./scripts/pil_bootstrap.py install --ocr
```

Core installs Pillow and NumPy. `--reconstruction` adds OpenCV and SciPy;
`--embedding` adds ONNX Runtime and checks a caller-supplied model; `--depth`
adds ONNX Runtime and checks the caller-supplied depth model (`--depth-model` or
`$PIL_AGENT_DEPTH_MODEL`) by running `pil_depth diagnose`; `--ocr`
checks Tesseract and installs it if needed using winget (Windows), Homebrew
(macOS), or apt-get/dnf (Linux). Install the platform package manager separately
if absent. Linux system installation may prompt through sudo, and Windows may
request elevation. Blender and model weights are not installed by this script.

The bootstrap uses uv if available, otherwise Python's venv/pip. It installs
the dependency ranges declared in `pyproject.toml` without updating the lockfile
or removing unselected extras. For the repository's lockfile-pinned development
environment, use the `uv sync` commands below instead. On Linux, the fallback
may require your distribution's `python3-venv` package.

Use **the same capability flags** when checking a prior installation. `check`
emits JSON without installing packages or writing state. Exit 0 and
`already_bootstrapped: true` mean both a matching successful receipt and passing
live probes. Exit 2 means setup is absent, stale, or incomplete; inspect
`ready`, `previously_run`, and `checks` to distinguish those cases. An existing
working venv can report `ready: true` before bootstrap has ever run.

Successful `install` writes `.venv/pil-agent-bootstrap.json`; repeated installs
with a matching receipt and passing probes skip installers. A receipt is not
trusted without live checks. Model diagnostics run each time, so moving or
breaking a configured model is detected. `--embedding` without a valid model
can install its Python packages but will refuse completion and write no new
success receipt. Configure models as described below; no models are guessed or
downloaded. Failed installs return 2 with a reason on stderr and empty stdout.

The bundled [bootstrap skill](skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md) handles this check-first
workflow for agents. It operates on the active plugin copy; bootstrapping a
source clone does not configure a separate installed cache. The receipt and
venv are local state, not portable installation evidence.

### Manual Python environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bsmi021/pil-agent-plugin.git
cd pil-agent-plugin
uv sync                        # installs Pillow + numpy into a local venv
uv sync --extra reconstruction # also installs OpenCV + SciPy
```

### Windows / PowerShell: OCR and embedding setup

From the repository root, install the Python dependencies and run the venv's
interpreter directly; activation is unnecessary. The embedding extra installs
the CPU runtime, but does not download model weights:

```powershell
uv sync --extra embedding
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe --version
winget install --id UB-Mannheim.TesseractOCR --exact
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\scripts\pil_ocr.py --diagnose
```

Tesseract's [Windows installation documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html)
links to the UB Mannheim installer. Discovery checks `--tesseract-executable`,
then `PIL_AGENT_TESSERACT`, then `PATH`, then Windows installations under
`ProgramFiles\Tesseract-OCR`, `ProgramFiles(x86)\Tesseract-OCR`,
`LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Tesseract-OCR`, and `LOCALAPPDATA\Tesseract-OCR`.
An invalid explicit or environment override refuses instead of falling back.
For a custom installation or language-data directory:

```powershell
$env:PIL_AGENT_TESSERACT = 'C:\Tools\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
$env:TESSDATA_PREFIX = 'C:\Tools\Tesseract-OCR\tessdata'
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\scripts\pil_ocr.py --diagnose --lang eng
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\scripts\pil_ocr.py 'C:\Images\sign.png' --lang eng
# A one-command override takes precedence over the environment:
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\scripts\pil_ocr.py --diagnose --tesseract-executable 'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
```

`--diagnose` probes the executable version and installed languages, including
each language requested in a combination such as `eng+deu`. Install the matching
Tesseract `.traineddata` files if a language is missing. Clear an obsolete
override with `Remove-Item Env:PIL_AGENT_TESSERACT` or
`Remove-Item Env:TESSDATA_PREFIX`.

Obtain an ONNX model separately and replace the example path below with its
actual location. For the gated models, check the SHA256 against **Requirements**
above; a different export is a different model even if its filename matches.
Configure the matching preprocessing profile explicitly:

```powershell
$env:PIL_AGENT_EMBED_MODEL = 'C:\Models\mobilenetv2-12.onnx'
$env:PIL_AGENT_EMBED_PREPROCESSING = 'imagenet'
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -LiteralPath $env:PIL_AGENT_EMBED_MODEL
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\scripts\pil_embed.py diagnose
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\scripts\pil_embed.py embed 'C:\Images\photo.jpg'

# For the CLIP visual-tower model described in Requirements:
$env:PIL_AGENT_EMBED_MODEL = 'C:\Models\clip-vit-b32-visual.onnx'
$env:PIL_AGENT_EMBED_PREPROCESSING = 'clip'
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\scripts\pil_embed.py diagnose
# Flags override the corresponding environment variables:
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\scripts\pil_embed.py diagnose --model 'C:\Models\mobilenetv2-12.onnx' --preprocessing imagenet
```

These `$env:` assignments affect the current PowerShell session and child
processes. To persist embedding configuration for future processes:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PIL_AGENT_EMBED_MODEL', $env:PIL_AGENT_EMBED_MODEL, 'User')
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PIL_AGENT_EMBED_PREPROCESSING', $env:PIL_AGENT_EMBED_PREPROCESSING, 'User')
```

Restart an already-running agent or terminal to inherit persisted changes.
Embedding diagnostics import ONNX Runtime, load the selected model on CPU,
check its declared input size against the profile, and report the interpreter,
runtime, model path/hash, gate status, and profile. This is a setup check with
no inference or calibration; it cannot detect a same-sized model paired with
the wrong normalization profile. Existing per-model capability claims still
apply unchanged. `compare` continues to require neither runtime nor model file.

Both diagnostic commands emit JSON on success (exit 0). Dependency/setup
refusals use exit 2, a named reason on stderr, and **empty stdout**, just like
normal OCR/embedding refusal. Check `$LASTEXITCODE` before consuming output.
If ONNX Runtime reports a Windows DLL load failure, install the current
[Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist)
matching your Python architecture, as required by the
[ONNX Runtime installation guide](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/install/).
For x64 Python, the PowerShell installation command is:

```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64 --exact
uv sync --extra embedding
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\scripts\pil_embed.py diagnose
```

### Plugin registration

Then install it as a plugin. The Claude Code CLI installs from *marketplaces*, not
from a bare directory path, so the repository ships a single-plugin marketplace
manifest and registers itself:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ./                                 # register this repo
claude plugin install pil-agent-plugin@pil-agent-plugin -s user  # all your projects
# or: ... -s project   for this project only
```

Verify with `claude plugin list` (or `/plugin` inside Claude Code) — you should see
`pil-agent-plugin` at scope `user`, enabled, with four skills and one agent.
`claude plugin details pil-agent-plugin` prints the component inventory.

Two things worth knowing:

- **Installing takes a snapshot copy**, versioned under
  `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`. Edits to your clone do not reach an installed
  plugin until you run `claude plugin update pil-agent-plugin`. If `uv sync` has
  already created `.venv/`, that is copied too — budget ~65 MB.
- **`claude plugin validate .` now validates the *marketplace* manifest**, which
  takes precedence at the repository root. To validate the plugin manifest, point
  at it directly: `claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/plugin.json --strict`.
- **Editing `marketplace.json` needs a refresh**: `claude plugin marketplace update
  pil-agent-plugin`. Editing the plugin itself needs `claude plugin update
  pil-agent-plugin`. They are separate caches.

<details>
<summary>Installing without <code>uv</code></summary>

The scripts only need Pillow and numpy, so any environment with those works:

```bash
pip install "pillow>=10.0" "numpy>=1.26"
claude plugin marketplace add ./
claude plugin install pil-agent-plugin@pil-agent-plugin -s user
```

The bundled skill prefers `uv` and falls back to a plain `python` invocation.
Skipping `uv sync` also keeps `.venv/` out of the installed snapshot.
</details>

## Usage

There are three ways in, from most to least automatic.

### 1. Just ask

Once installed, the `image-measurement` skill is invoked automatically when your
request calls for it. Its description triggers on questions like:

- *"Do these two screenshots match?"*
- *"Did this render keep the reference's colour scheme?"*
- *"What exactly changed between these two versions?"*
- *"What are the exact colours in this logo?"*

For work that crosses from images into calibrated multi-view constraints or
Blender geometry, the `image-analysis` umbrella skill composes
`image-measurement` with `multiview-reconstruction`. It keeps visual
interpretation, pixel measurement, reconstruction residuals, and scene geometry
as separate evidence layers, then combines them in one report.

### 2. The comparison agent

For a rigorous two-image comparison, invoke the bundled
`image-comparison-analyst` agent. It is deliberately structured to look **first**
and measure **second**:

1. Reads both images and commits to a visual description, so the numbers cannot
   anchor its perception.
2. Runs both measurement tools on the pair.
3. Reports where vision and measurement **disagree** — rather than silently
   deferring to whichever spoke last.

It reports findings only; it never edits files.

### 3. Direct CLI

Both tools emit JSON on stdout, are deterministic (repeated runs are
byte-identical, so output can be committed and diffed), and accept one image
(analyse) or two (analyse and diff).

```bash
uv run python scripts/pil_image_analyze.py  "reference.png"                # maximal one-call profile
uv run python scripts/pil_image_analyze.py  "reference.png" "render.png"   # full comparison, one call
uv run python scripts/pil_palette_diff.py   "reference.png"
uv run python scripts/pil_palette_diff.py   "reference.png" "render.png"
uv run python scripts/pil_structure_diff.py "reference.png" "render.png" --grid 4x3
uv run python scripts/pil_structure_diff.py "view_a.png" "view_b.png" --foreground
```

With the optional extras, the semantic layers run the same way — note that
each embedding model is paired with the preprocessing profile it was
trained with, and the payload records which was used:

```bash
uv run python scripts/pil_ocr.py "sign.jpg" --region "0.3,0.4,0.7,0.55" --psm 6
uv run --extra embedding python scripts/pil_embed.py embed "a.jpg" "b.jpg" \
    --model mobilenetv2-12.onnx     --preprocessing imagenet   # same-image ID
uv run --extra embedding python scripts/pil_embed.py embed "a.jpg" "b.jpg" \
    --model clip-vit-b32-visual.onnx --preprocessing clip      # + related-scene ranking
uv run python scripts/pil_semantic_record.py seal "a.jpg" --claims claims.json
```

`pil_image_analyze.py` is the one-call entry point: it composes the file-fact,
palette and structure tools (their blocks are content-identical to standalone
runs) and adds what none of them emit for a single image — persistable
dhash/ahash **fingerprints** (hex strings comparable across runs by Hamming
distance, so an image profiled today can be identified against a payload
stored last week), exact tonal percentiles and clipping fractions, per-channel
statistics, an exact distinct-colour count and greyscale test, and
edge/sharpness diagnostics. With two images it also contains both tools'
pairwise diffs verbatim plus all four fingerprint distances.

Always quote paths — image filenames routinely contain spaces and parentheses.

**Use `--foreground` (both tools) when comparing object renders** — a model on a
preview backdrop, a product shot, a sprite. Full-frame metrics include the
background, and a shared backdrop can be ~98% of both frames: two *different*
swords measured 0.991 full-frame structural similarity because the background was
doing the scoring. Foreground mode masks the background out (alpha when the file
carries real transparency, border-median OKLab colour otherwise — the same
visible-pixel definition as the Synty asset index), crops to the object's
bounding box so position in frame stops mattering, and scores only grid cells
with real foreground support. When you *don't* pass it, the tools estimate
foreground coverage anyway and flag `background_dominant` on mostly-background
frames — treat that flag as "these scores describe the backdrop".

### Concept-image depth (`pil_depth`)

A concept image has no depth data. `pil_depth estimate` asks a monocular depth
model for one, and `pil_depth compare` checks that answer against the exact depth
of a Blender render. The output of `estimate` is **model-inferred relative inverse
depth** (larger = nearer, arbitrary scale and shift per image): it is not metric,
carries no scene units, and for stylised concept art it is a learned guess. The
payload says so (`depth_kind: "relative_inverse_depth"`, `metric: false`,
`interpretation_limits`).

```bash
uv run --extra embedding python scripts/pil_depth.py estimate concept.png \
    --model depth_anything_v2_vits.onnx --output-dir out/ [--mask selection.json]
uv run python scripts/pil_depth.py compare out/concept_inverse_depth.npy \
    render_depth.npy --output-dir out/ [--mask mask.png]
```

- `estimate` writes `<stem>_inverse_depth.npy` (float32, the image's height x
  width) and a heatmap PNG, and records the model file, its **sha256** and the
  named preprocessing profile (`depth-anything-v2`: shorter side 518, each side a
  multiple of 14, bicubic, ImageNet mean/std, or the model's own static input
  size when it has one). `--mask` is a `selection-mask-v1` manifest from
  `pil_mask.py` bound to that image; it scopes the statistics and heatmap
  normalisation, while the `.npy` stays the full model output. Alpha is
  composited onto black before inference.
- `compare` takes that `.npy` and the `.npy` from
  `blender_inspect_render --modes depth` (metric depth, NaN background). It
  converts the render to inverse depth, fits **scale and shift by least squares
  over the pixels valid in both** (and inside `--mask`, a binary PNG at the
  render's size), and reports the Spearman rank correlation, AbsRel after
  alignment, the fitted `scale`/`shift`, and a disagreement heatmap with the worst
  grid cells as fractional `L,T,R,B` boxes. The render's grid is the target: a
  concept map of a different size is bilinearly resampled to it only when the
  aspect ratios agree within 1%, otherwise `compare` refuses. It cannot check
  that the two maps show the same framing beyond that.
- Nothing is calibrated: there is no pass/fail threshold for Spearman or AbsRel,
  and because scale and shift are fitted away, agreement says the depth *order*
  and shape match, not that distances are right.

**Obtaining the model.** The tool needs an ONNX export of Depth Anything V2
**Small** (the ViT-S variant, about 25M parameters). Only the **Small** model is
released under **Apache-2.0**; the Base, Large and Giant models carry a
CC-BY-NC-4.0 (non-commercial) licence, so do not substitute them where that
matters. The upstream weights are published by the Depth Anything V2 authors
(github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2); an ONNX export is either made from
those weights or taken from a community export of the Small model. This
repository does not bundle or download it, and does not pin a download URL. Read
the licence of the file you actually obtain, then confirm it loads with
`pil_depth diagnose --model <file>` (or `pil_bootstrap check --depth --depth-model
<file>`): the payload gives its sha256, and `model_known` is `false` until that
hash has been run in this repository.

## Worked example

Two images, identical in layout and lightness. The only difference is that one
small accent stripe changes from cyan to orange.

```bash
uv run python scripts/pil_palette_diff.py before.png after.png
```

```json
{
  "accent_hue_shift_detected": true,
  "hue_families_lost":      ["cyan"],
  "hue_families_gained":    ["orange"],
  "hue_families_diminished":["cyan"],
  "base_palette_distance":  1.6432,
  "accent_palette_distance": 67.6892
}
```

Now the same pair through the structure tool:

```json
{
  "structural_similarity": 0.999097,
  "dhash_distance": 0,
  "changed_area_fraction": 0.007241,
  "changed_region_bbox_fractional": [0.0625, 0.1871, 0.3164, 0.2222]
}
```

**This is the whole argument in one example.** `structural_similarity` says 0.999
and `dhash_distance` says 0 — both are *blind* to the change, because they are
luminance-based and the edit preserved luminance. Only the hue census catches it.
Meanwhile `changed_region_bbox_fractional` pinpoints *where* it happened.

A caller reading only a similarity score or a hash would have concluded "identical".

## Choosing a metric

For input preparation, selections, registration, local change regions, domain
profiles, discovery and MCP, use the [0.9.0 workflow guide](docs/measurement-workflows.md).

| Question | Tool | Field |
|---|---|---|
| Everything measurable about an image, one call | `pil_image_analyze` | full profile: `file` + `colour` + `structure` + `fingerprints` + `tonal` + `channels` + `detail` |
| Fingerprint an image for later identification | `pil_image_analyze` | `fingerprints.full_frame.dhash`/`ahash` — hex, cross-run comparable |

**Consult both tools for any "do these match?" question.** They are blind to
different things. And **read `flags` before any score**: `background_dominant`,
`accent_support_low`, `foreground_too_small` and friends each name a specific
way the numbers beside them are weakened. `accent_hue_shift_detected` is
support-gated — a hue family needs both a minimum pixel count and a minimum
frame fraction before its appearance or disappearance can flip the verdict, so
a stray anti-aliased pixel cannot — but with `accent_support_low` flagged, even
the gated verdict should not influence a decision.

### Colour is reported three ways, deliberately

| Field | Answers |
|---|---|
| `base_palette` | Which colours dominate **by area** |
| `accent_palette` | Which colours dominate among **vivid pixels only** |
| `hue_families` | Which hues are **present at all**, regardless of area |

**Read `hue_families` when a colour matters semantically.** Area-weighted palettes
systematically miss small vivid accents. In the validation image, a cyan occupying
**0.485% of the frame** encoded an entire UI state — and it appeared in *neither*
palette, only in the hue census. Semantic importance and pixel area are
uncorrelated.

Do not rely on `base_palette_distance` for colour-scheme questions: measured
against a real recolour, it scored the changed image as *more* similar than an
unchanged rescale.

### Direction of comparison

`hue_families_lost` / `_gained` / `_diminished` / `_amplified` and
`hue_family_fraction_deltas` describe what the **second** image did relative to the
first. `accent_hue_shift_detected` and both palette distances are symmetric under
swapping the two.

## Scope limit: these tools do not measure geometry

`edge_mean` and `entropy` are 2D image-complexity proxies. They are **not** polygon
counts, mesh density, or topology, and must not be used as a proxy for them.
Shading, normal maps, lighting and camera angle all move these numbers
independently of the underlying model — a smooth-shaded low-poly render can score
as *more* complex than a flat-shaded high-poly one.

For polygon, mesh or topology questions, query the 3D scene's own statistics (for
example via a Blender MCP server) instead of analysing a render. Inferring geometry
from pixels produces confident, wrong answers.

This limit is emitted in every `pil_structure_diff` payload under
`interpretation_limits`, and enforced by a test, so it travels with the data rather
than living only in this README.

## Development

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest -v
```

**972 tests** in `tests/` (plus 312 in `plugins/blender-inspect/tests`, run with `uv run pytest -q plugins/blender-inspect/tests`). Fixtures are generated synthetically in-process, so no binary test
assets are committed.

Six tests confirm results against a real reference image and **skip when it is
absent** — so a fresh clone reports those six as skipped, which is expected.
Their strongest assertions are duplicated unskipped against a synthetic
stand-in, so a clean checkout still guards every known regression. A further
nineteen tests across `tests/test_blender_mesh.py`, `tests/test_blender_render.py`
and `tests/test_character_sheet_review.py` run only when an external corpus
and a Blender install are both present — the corpus path defaults to a known
location and can be overridden per test file, mirroring
`PIL_AGENT_REFERENCE_IMAGE` (see
[`runs/2026-08-20-blender-mesh-validation/`](https://github.com/bsmi021/pil-agent-plugin/blob/pil-agent-plugin--v0.9.3/runs/2026-08-20-blender-mesh-validation/README.md),
[`runs/2026-08-20-blender-render-validation/`](https://github.com/bsmi021/pil-agent-plugin/blob/pil-agent-plugin--v0.9.3/runs/2026-08-20-blender-render-validation/README.md),
[`runs/2026-08-20-character-sheet-loop/`](https://github.com/bsmi021/pil-agent-plugin/blob/pil-agent-plugin--v0.9.3/runs/2026-08-20-character-sheet-loop/README.md));
they are already counted as passing above on a machine that has both, and skip
cleanly otherwise.

To run those six, point the env var at any complex, predominantly dark image with
small vivid accents:

```bash
PIL_AGENT_REFERENCE_IMAGE="/path/to/image.png" uv run pytest -v
```

The original validation image is not distributed.

## How this was validated

Design decisions here came from measurement, not anticipation. The evidence bundle
in [`runs/2026-08-18-pil-agent-plugin-phase1/`](https://github.com/bsmi021/pil-agent-plugin/blob/pil-agent-plugin--v0.9.3/runs/2026-08-18-pil-agent-plugin-phase1/README.md)
contains a 13-step RED→GREEN ledger, the raw JSON outputs, and a
[metric discrimination matrix](https://github.com/bsmi021/pil-agent-plugin/blob/pil-agent-plugin--v0.9.3/runs/2026-08-18-pil-agent-plugin-phase1/10-metric-discrimination-matrix.md)
showing that **only 4 of 11 metrics** separate a genuine colour change from a
no-op rescale — and that one metric answers the question backwards.

The tools were then taken to a real production task — reviewing a Blender game
character against its concept sheet — in
[`runs/2026-08-18-skeleton-warrior-asset-review/`](https://github.com/bsmi021/pil-agent-plugin/blob/pil-agent-plugin--v0.9.3/runs/2026-08-18-skeleton-warrior-asset-review/README.md).
That trial is the strongest evidence for the vision-first method in this repository:
**four of the reviewing agent's own confident visual conclusions were wrong**, and
measurement caught all four before they reached the defect list. Two would have sent
an artist to fix work that was already correct. It also records `pil_structure_diff`
correctly *refusing* the comparison via its own `aspect_ratio_mismatch` flag, and
draws a hard line between what the plugin measured and what harness code around it
measured.

The same rule governs the embedding layer: a capability is advertised only where a
discrimination gate measured it. The first gate
([`runs/2026-08-31-embedding-discrimination/`](https://github.com/bsmi021/pil-agent-plugin/blob/pil-agent-plugin--v0.9.3/runs/2026-08-31-embedding-discrimination/README.md))
**demoted** same-venue matching under `mobilenetv2-12` because two exhibits of one
museum (0.4558) scored *below* an unrelated pair (0.4701). The follow-up
([`runs/2026-09-02-clip-embedding-discrimination/`](https://github.com/bsmi021/pil-agent-plugin/blob/pil-agent-plugin--v0.9.3/runs/2026-09-02-clip-embedding-discrimination/README.md))
re-ran that identical corpus and pair list against a CLIP ViT-B/32 visual encoder,
which separates all three bands — so the capability is advertised **for that model
only**, keyed by its sha256, and every ungated model is flagged as such. That run
also records a control worth knowing: feeding CLIP the wrong preprocessing profile
does not fail loudly, it quietly costs 36% of the margin.

## Status

**0.10.0 — two-plugin layout and concept-image depth.** The repository now
ships two plugins from one marketplace: `pil-agent-plugin` (image measurement)
and `blender-inspect` (Blender scenes; see
[`plugins/blender-inspect/`](plugins/blender-inspect/README.md)). The Blender
tools `pil_blender_mesh`, `pil_blender_fit`, `pil_blender_render` and
`pil_multiview_render` are **deprecated**: they print a deprecation notice, are
marked deprecated in the capability catalog, and are removed in the next minor
release. They behave as before except `pil_multiview_render`: in Blender 5.2 it
put every horizontal view's camera at the world origin, and it now places them
correctly, so its renders change. Their replacements are `blender_mesh`,
`blender_fit`, `blender_render` and `blender_multiview_render` in
`blender-inspect`. New: `pil_depth` (Depth Anything V2 Small ONNX, caller-supplied
and sha256-pinned) estimates relative depth of a concept image and compares it
with a Blender render's exact depth. Skills and the comparison agent route
Blender work to `blender-inspect`.

**0.9.6 — literal environment reads.** OCR install discovery and the test
suite read environment settings by literal name, and process tests start from
the allowlisted tool environment. No image-processing behavior changed.

**0.9.5 — directory review clean-up.** `pil_embed.py` reads its two settings
by literal name, and the image-analysis skill names a concrete discovery
command. No image-processing behavior changed.

**0.9.4 — lean plugin tree.** Working evidence bundles under `runs/` are no
longer tracked; the published copies remain at the `pil-agent-plugin--v0.9.3`
tag. The lockfile covers Python 3.11–3.13, the versions CI tests. No
image-processing behavior changed.

**0.9.3 — credential isolation.** MCP tool processes inherit only the OS and
local model/OCR settings they need. Bootstrap ignores local package-manager
configuration and credential stores when installing public dependencies.
The plugin itself needs no user credential.

**0.9.2 — plugin submission metadata and privacy.** Adds an icon to the Codex
manifest and explains local processing, setup downloads, and host-agent data
handling. Includes a linked privacy policy and ignores common local credential
files. No image-processing behavior changed.

**0.9.1 — Astra-ready skill guidance.** Rewrites the four shipped skill
entrypoints around concise activation, progressive disclosure, task-specific
routing, proportional decision boundaries, and explicit completion. The
measurement, calibration, embedding, reconstruction, and Blender behavior is
unchanged. See the [Astra skill audit](docs/astra-skill-audit-2026-09-12.html).

**0.9.0 — explicit measurement workflows and agent tooling.** Adds EXIF/ICC
normalization with preserved alpha and coordinate provenance; model/profile
configuration-aware embedding claims; image-bound raster/polygon masks and a
pipeline that composes the original image tools; bounded translation/rigid/affine
registration with raw/aligned evidence; native ΔE/alpha change regions, heatmaps,
crops and optional standard SSIM; domain profiles with source-group holdouts,
leakage checks, measured error rates and profile identity checks; and a public
tool catalog, failure-preserving batches and optional stdio MCP adapter.
Bootstrap accepts `--comparison` and `--mcp`. Legacy default measurements remain
unchanged apart from the release version and corrected embedding eligibility.
New defaults remain diagnostic unless a compatible evaluated profile is used.
See [usage](docs/measurement-workflows.md) and
[execution evidence](docs/verification-0.9.0.md).

**0.8.0 — platform bootstrap and dependency diagnostics.** Adds a Python
bootstrap for a plugin-local environment on Windows, macOS, and Linux, with
opt-in OCR, embedding, and reconstruction dependencies. Its check command
distinguishes a recorded successful bootstrap from current readiness, rechecks
live dependencies, and skips repeat installation only when both pass. A bundled
bootstrap skill guides agents through setup and status checks.

OCR now discovers standard Windows Tesseract installations and supports an
environment override and image-free executable/language diagnostics. Embedding
diagnostics validate runtime/model setup; DLL and model-load failures preserve
exit 2 with empty stdout. PowerShell installation and model/profile configuration
commands are documented. Focused process tests exercise missing/discovered
dependencies, override precedence, paths with spaces, and bootstrap lifecycle.
Model weights remain caller-supplied; embedding claims and calibration results
are unchanged.

**0.7.0 — one-call profiling and the semantic layers.** `pil_image_analyze`
composes the file-fact, palette and structure tools into a single maximal
profile and adds persistable hex fingerprints, tonal percentiles and clipping
fractions, channel statistics and (uncalibrated) detail diagnostics.
`pil_semantic_record` seals vision claims to an image's exact sha256 —
attributable and checkable, never a truth claim. `pil_ocr` reads text with
frame-mapped boxes and feeds those records. `pil_embed` adds ONNX embedding
fingerprints under the new optional `embedding` extra, with per-model
preprocessing profiles and advertised capabilities keyed by model sha256:
`mobilenetv2-12` is gated for same-image identification only, while CLIP
ViT-B/32 also passes same-venue ranking on full band separation
([`runs/2026-09-02-clip-embedding-discrimination/`](https://github.com/bsmi021/pil-agent-plugin/blob/pil-agent-plugin--v0.9.3/runs/2026-09-02-clip-embedding-discrimination/README.md)).
Ungated models advertise nothing. Existing tool payload shapes are unchanged.

**0.6.0 — constrained multi-view reconstruction.** The optional
`multiview-reconstruction` skill adds OpenCV contour preparation, a SciPy
least-squares template solver with full-rank and conflict refusal states,
Blender BVH clearance probing/bounded copy fitting, arbitrary locked-framing
Workbench renders, and worst-case review over every named view. The core
Pillow/NumPy install and existing `image-measurement` behavior are unchanged.
See [`docs/phase4-scope.md`](docs/phase4-scope.md).

**0.5.0 — Phase 3 complete.** All of Track A5 and Track B1/B2/B3 now ships
alongside Track A1-A4 from 0.4.0. The release also closes the first PR #7
critic round: hard-failed views make every contract predicate UNMEASURABLE,
character-sheet JSON contains stable logical render identifiers rather than
deleted temporary paths, support-insufficient comparisons refuse, and Blender
renders are staged atomically so failure preserves any caller-owned output.

**Track B2 + B3 — the character-sheet loop ships.** `pil_blender_render.py`
renders front/side/back from a `.blend` scene (headless Blender Workbench,
auto-framed from the mesh bounding box) and registers each against a
caller-supplied reference via `pil_structure_diff --foreground`;
`pil_character_sheet_review.py` composes those matched views into one
`pil_contract_verdict --pairs` call, so a whole character-sheet review is a
single contract evaluated over N registered pairs — worst-case aggregated,
proven end to end on real renders (a deliberately swapped view is not
averaged away by two good ones; a hard-failed view is represented, not
dropped). Verified against a real production character
(`C:\Projects\tms-heim\art\skeleton-crusaders\brute\`): the camera-axis
convention was verified two independent ways rather than assumed, a real
render-determinism defect (Blender's per-render PNG metadata) was found and
fixed, and matched real renders VIOLATE Phase 2's calibrated similarity
thresholds — an honest content-difference finding, not a defect; both new
tools accept `--thresholds` for callers who need a different bar. Cross-machine
render determinism is not claimed, only same-machine/same-install; comparison
metrics on a fixed image pair remain fully deterministic everywhere. Full
numbers: [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md#status).

Track A5's three new-metric candidates each ran a real discrimination gate,
and it did its job: connected-component counting, silhouette shape descriptors
and projection-profile alignment were all **demoted** — each tool still exists,
is tested, and degrades honestly (a demoted candidate reports real diagnostic
numbers with an explicit low-confidence flag, never a silent overclaim), but
none is advertised as a validated discrimination capability. The one A5
candidate that ships is `pil_alignment`'s **WCAG contrast** half, which needed
no gate — verified against the standard's own published worked examples.

Track B1 ships: `pil_blender_mesh.py` reads real polygon/vertex/material
counts and bounding dimensions from a Blender scene headlessly, and
`pil_contract_verdict.py`'s `geometry.*` predicates now resolve real verdicts
when scene stats are supplied (refusing exactly as before when they are not).
Verified against a real production asset's revision history — including
resolving a genuine discrepancy between two sources of "ground truth" and
finding a claimed "topology-preserving" pair was actually scene-level
violated. Full numbers: [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md#status),
[`docs/phase3-scope.md`](docs/phase3-scope.md#sequencing-and-gates).

**0.4.0 — coverage-weighted foreground, three new tools, region scoping.**

The headline fix: on RGBA input in `--foreground` mode, statistics are now
coverage-weighted. Previously a partially-covered edge pixel was composited onto
black and then counted like a fully-opaque one, which read a 5px-wide blade
**27.9 code values too dark** and — worse — made the reading depend on *where*
the object landed on the pixel grid, so a quarter-pixel re-render of an
unchanged asset could cross a calibrated threshold and report a change that
never happened. Measured after the fix: error against alpha-weighted truth is
**±0.0004** across all 19 corpus scenes, and the placement excursion is
**±0.0006** against a bound of 0.5. Full-frame behaviour is byte-identical.

Three new tools close the loop between measurement and vision:
[`pil_crop`](scripts/pil_crop.py) hands vision a native-resolution view of a
region the tools located, [`pil_annotate`](scripts/pil_annotate.py) draws
numbered boxes so a model can point precisely, and
[`pil_image_info`](scripts/pil_image_info.py) reports the file facts an image
never carries into a vision encoder. `--region` scopes every metric on both
diff tools, byte-equal to pre-cropping with `pil_crop`.

Foreground thresholds are now [split by mask source](https://github.com/bsmi021/pil-agent-plugin/blob/pil-agent-plugin--v0.9.3/runs/2026-08-20-foreground-recalibration/README.md)
and the alpha path is calibrated for the first time (luminance **0.997** against
the estimate path's 34.166, n=380, α=0.01). The annotation tool's legibility is
[verified by read-back](https://github.com/bsmi021/pil-agent-plugin/blob/pil-agent-plugin--v0.9.3/runs/2026-08-20-annotate-readback/README.md) — fresh
agents shown only the image transcribed 27 of 27 numerals correctly, and the
bundle records an earlier round that *failed*.

Phase 1 complete: tools built and validated, plugin packaged,
`claude plugin validate --strict` passing, and the package audited against and
conforming to [Agent Plugins 1.0.0](#standards-conformance).

0.2.0 adds foreground separation, driven by a production failure: run over two
asset renders sharing a preview background, full-frame similarity scored two
different objects 0.991. Both tools now estimate foreground coverage and flag
`background_dominant`, accept `--foreground` for masked, bbox-registered
measurement (alpha-derived or border-median OKLab, matching the Synty asset
index's visible-pixel definition), and support-gate the hue-shift verdict so a
handful of anti-aliased pixels cannot flip it.

0.3.0 implements [phase 2](docs/phase2-scope.md) in full: CIEDE2000 colour
distance hand-rolled in numpy and verified against all 34 published Sharma
reference values (`base/accent_palette_distance_de2000` are now the primary
colour signal); Neyman–Pearson threshold calibration over synthetic ground
truth with published per-metric detection limits (the
[calibration bundle](https://github.com/bsmi021/pil-agent-plugin/blob/pil-agent-plugin--v0.9.3/runs/2026-08-19-phase2-calibration/README.md) records
every derived constant with its n, α and CI — including one derivation that was
*rejected*, with the reason in `scripts/pil_common.py`); an opt-in LCh accent
gate (`--accent-space lch`); and `pil_contract_verdict.py` — declared-intent
verdicts where every null result carries its detection limit, `geometry.*` and
`style.*` refuse rather than approximate, and multi-pair aggregation is
worst-case so one broken view cannot be averaged away.

Those thresholds were then
[validated against a real production corpus](https://github.com/bsmi021/pil-agent-plugin/blob/pil-agent-plugin--v0.9.3/runs/2026-08-20-phase2-real-validation/README.md)
— a game asset's actual revision history — rather than only the synthetic data
they were derived from: **zero false alarms** across 160 real no-change controls
in full-frame mode, 21 of 24 real revision pairs detected in both modes, and the
three undetected ones below the published 2%-of-frame detection limit exactly as
that limit predicts. The published detection limits transfer to production
input, which is what makes a `SATISFIED` invariant's limit worth reading.

Known limitations, tracked in [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md#open-items):

- Thresholds are calibrated against a small sample and need broader validation.
- CIEDE2000 is the primary palette-distance signal; legacy Euclidean RGB
  distance remains supporting detail.
- Declared-intent contracts are supported, but geometry/style claims still
  require their own evidence, and thresholds do not transfer between domains.
- Domain profiles require representative source-disjoint data. The four-domain
  execution examples demonstrate operation, not production-domain accuracy.
