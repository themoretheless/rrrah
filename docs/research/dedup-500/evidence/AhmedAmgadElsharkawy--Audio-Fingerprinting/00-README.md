## Features

- **Spectrogram Generation**: The program iterates over songs in the shared folder, generating spectrograms for the full song, music, and vocals.

- **Feature Extraction**: For each spectrogram, key features are extracted, analyzed, and stored in a file. This allows for perceptual hashing to create a unique fingerprint for each song.

- **Perceptual Hashing**: Extracted features are hashed using perceptual hash functions to generate a compact representation of each song for easier identification.

- **Song Similarity Search**: Given any input sound file (song, vocals, or music), the program generates a spectrogram, extracts features, and compares it to the Database, outputting a sorted list of similar songs with a similarity index.

- **Weighted Average Song Mixing**: Users can select two files and control their contribution weight via a slider. The software then treats the combination as a new song and searches for similar songs in the Database, giving preference to the original files based on their similarity index.
