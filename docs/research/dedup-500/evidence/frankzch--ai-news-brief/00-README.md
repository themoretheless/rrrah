# AI News Brief

**English** | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

An open-source, self-hostable **AI news aggregator** that turns 94 sources — AI lab blogs, Hacker News, Reddit, 35 AI builders on X, 13 YouTube channels (via transcripts) and GitHub Trending — into a deduplicated **daily AI digest** with English and Chinese summaries. It is the engine behind [inbrief.info](https://inbrief.info); if you just want to read the digest, use the site or the [agent skill](https://github.com/frankzch/ai-news-skill) instead of self-hosting.

It continuously pulls AI-related content from RSS feeds, Hacker News, Reddit, X (Twitter), YouTube and GitHub Trending, then runs every item through an LLM pipeline — relevance filtering, bilingual (EN/ZH) summarization, tag extraction, importance scoring — deduplicates it in two stages, and stores the curated result in PostgreSQL.

```
scheduler (main.py)
  └─ pipeline_runner ─ fetchers (RSS / HN / Reddit / X / YouTube / GitHub Trending)
       └─ content_processor  (trafilatura + curl_cffi + DrissionPage fallbacks)
            └─ ai_engine     (LLM: filter / summarize / tag / score)
                 └─ dedup    (SimHash quick screen + pgvector semantic)
                      └─ PostgreSQL (articles, auto-created schema)
```

## Features

- **Multi-source fetchers** — RSS/Atom, Hugging Face weekly papers, Hacker News (with comment threads), Reddit (subreddit hot or keyword search), X.com keyword search, YouTube (with transcript extraction), GitHub Trending.
- **Anti-bot resilient scraping** — layered strategy: `curl_cffi` TLS impersonation → DrissionPage real browser → httpx; Playwright with a persistent login profile for Reddit / X / YouTube.
- **LLM curation** — per-category prompts (news / discussion / video / opensource) produce bilingual summaries, tags and an importance score; any OpenAI-compatible API works (DeepSeek by default).
- **Two-stage deduplication** — SimHash fingerprint quick screening, then pgvector cosine similarity with dynamic thresholds (stricter for last-24h articles).
- **Engagement gates & delayed re-scan** — low-traction posts are recorded and re-checked later instead of being fetched repeatedly.
- **Optional content moderation** — Aliyun Green text moderation before storage (skipped when keys are absent).

## Source catalog

The production instance at [inbrief.info](https://inbrief.info) currently tracks **94 sources** across four categories. The engine ships with an empty source table — use this catalog as a starting point and add the ones you want via `admin_rss.py`.

### 🚀 Open source — GitHub Trending

Weekly [GitHub Trending](https://github.com/trending?since=weekly) repositories (top 25 by default), each summarized from its README and repo metadata. Configured in `config.yaml` under `fetching.github_trending` — no source entry needed.


## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL with the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension (a free Supabase project works out of the box)
- An OpenAI-compatible LLM API key

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium

cp .env.example .env        # fill in LLM key + Postgres URL
```

Enable pgvector once in your database:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

All tables are created automatically on first run.

Add some sources (they live in the `rss_sources` table):

```bash
python admin_rss.py add https://openai.com/news/rss.xml "OpenAI Blog" --category news
python admin_rss.py add https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/ "r/LocalLLaMA" --category discussion
python admin_rss.py list
```

Source routing is inferred from the URL: `reddit.com/r/<sub>` → subreddit hot posts, `reddit.com` + a description starting with `keyword ` → Reddit keyword search, `x.com` → X keyword search, YouTube channel feeds → transcript pipeline, everything else → RSS/Atom. GitHub Trending is enabled in `config.yaml` and needs no source entry.

Run:

```bash
python main.py --now   # single fetch round, good for a first test
python main.py         # scheduler mode: runs every schedule.interval_hours
```

Models, timeouts, engagement thresholds, per-platform quotas and retention are all in [config.yaml](config.yaml).

## Query it from your AI agent — no self-hosting

Don't want to run the pipeline yourself? The same curated feed is available as an **agent skill** that talks to the hosted [inbrief.info](https://inbrief.info) API — drop it into Claude Code / Codex / OpenClaw / Antigravity and just ask in plain English. No keys, no scraping, works out of the box.

```bash
# Claude Code (other agents: swap the target dir, e.g. ~/.codex/skills, ~/.agents/skills)
git clone https://github.com/frankzch/ai-news-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/ai-news-skill
```

The agent turns your intent into precise filters (category, source, time range, count, summary length, language):

- *"AI videos from top KOLs in the past 5 days, exclude Fireship."*
- *"Today's AI news, but drop TechReview."*
- *"Reddit AI discussions from the past 3 days, long summaries."*

Guests get up to 3 items per request; sign up free at [inbrief.info](https://inbrief.info) for more. Full details: **[github.com/frankzch/ai-news-skill](https://github.com/frankzch/ai-news-skill)**.

## Notes

- Reddit / X / YouTube fetching drives a real Chromium via Playwright. On first run you may be prompted to log in once in the opened browser window; the session persists in `data/playwright_profile` (git-ignored, stays on your machine).
- Summaries are stored bilingually (`*_en` / `*_zh` columns). If you only need one language you can simply ignore the other.
- The `data/` directory holds runtime state (browser profile, cookies, daily flags) and is never committed.

## FAQ

**How is this different from an RSS reader?**
An RSS reader shows every item from every feed. This pipeline also pulls Reddit, X, Hacker News comment threads and YouTube transcripts, drops off-topic and low-engagement items, merges duplicates of the same story across sources, and writes a short summary and importance score for each one.

**Which LLM does it need?**
Any OpenAI-compatible API; DeepSeek is the default. Set the model and key in `.env` / [config.yaml](config.yaml).

**Can I read the digest without self-hosting?**
Yes. The same feed is free to browse at [inbrief.info](https://inbrief.info), or query it from Claude Code / Codex with the [agent skill](https://github.com/frankzch/ai-news-skill).
