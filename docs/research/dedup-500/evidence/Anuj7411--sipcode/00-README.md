## Install in 30 seconds

```bash
npm i -g sipcode
sipcode init
```

That is it. Your next Claude Code session will use Sipcode automatically. Verify a few minutes later:

```bash
sipcode drift
```

If the output reads `no drift, context health stable`, Sipcode is doing its job.

> **Already installed? Keep it fresh.** Sipcode makes zero network calls, so it can't pop an "update available" notice. Build a weekly habit: run `sipcode update` (or `npm i -g sipcode@latest`) to pull the latest fixes. Full details in [Updating Sipcode](#updating-sipcode).

## What is Sipcode?

Sipcode is a free command-line tool that sits between you and Claude Code. It does three things:

1. It watches Claude Code's context window and warns you when it starts to bloat (we call this "context rot")
2. It catches duplicate file reads and other waste before they reach Claude, so you pay less for the same answers
3. It gives you receipts. Every saving is measurable in your terminal.

It is open source under the MIT license. It makes zero network calls during normal use. Your data never leaves your laptop.

## How Sipcode compares

| | Sipcode | Tool A | Tool B | Tool C |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Approach** | Live PreToolUse hook | Cross-session memory store | Static methodology | RAG retrieval server |
| **Caps verbose tool output** | ✓ | ✗ | docs only | ✗ |
| **Dedups same-session re-reads** | ✓ | ✗ | docs only | ✗ |
| **Mid-session install support** | ✓ Verified Warm-Fill | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| **Zero false-dedup by construction** | ✓ | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| **Reproducible benchmark on locked corpus** | ✓ 62.6% median (20 tasks) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| **Self-introspection MCP tools** | ✓ 15 tools | ✗ | ✗ | partial |
| **Zero network calls in normal use** | ✓ | ✓ | n/a | ✗ |
| **MIT licensed** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

Sipcode is **complementary to memory tools** that persist context across sessions (Tool A in the table). Sipcode keeps each individual session clean. They solve different problems. Run both for maximum effect.

## Why you probably want it

If you use Claude Code for real work, you have already felt this:

- Long sessions get expensive fast. A two-hour session on Claude Max can burn through your daily plan
- Quality drops as the context window fills. Claude starts re-reading files, repeating itself, losing the thread of what you asked
- You cannot tell what is bloat and what is signal

Sipcode measures the bloat, then removes the parts Claude does not need. The savings are not theoretical. Run `sipcode benchmark` on any machine and you will see the same 62.6% median reduction on the locked 20-task corpus.

---

## The two-minute tour

After installing, here are the five commands that show you what Sipcode is doing.

### 1. `sipcode drift`

Tells you if your current Claude Code session is drifting from your normal usage pattern. Bloated context, repeated reads, stale signals are all flagged here.

```
✓ Sipcode drift: no drift, context health stable vs your recent baseline.
```

### 2. `sipcode proxy --stats`

Shows what Sipcode caught in the current session, broken down by rewriter.

```
Sipcode proxy, rewrite stats
  total rewrites:    144
  est. tokens saved: ~288,685 (heuristic)
  signal kept:       67% (med), weighted across all rewrites
```

### 3. `sipcode benchmark`

Runs the locked 20-task corpus and produces a verifiable savings number. Anyone, anywhere can run this and get 62.6%.

```
62.6%  median savings on a locked 20-task corpus
       range 37.4% to 80.6%   3,567,170 tokens   $67.43
```

### 4. `sipcode today`

Daily spend summary. Tokens used, sessions, output ratio, comparison to your 30-day median.

```
spend so far    $1.20    across 4 sessions
tokens so far   943.8K   output ratio 3.7%
```

### 5. `sipcode forecast`

Month-end projection based on your last 14 days.

```
projected month-end   $17,674   (range $14,139 to $21,208)
```

## How to install (more detail)

Sipcode works on Mac, Linux, and Windows. You need Node.js 18 or newer.

### Step 1. Install Node.js

Skip this step if you already have Node.js. Otherwise:

- **Mac:** `brew install node`
- **Linux (Ubuntu / Debian):** `sudo apt install nodejs npm`
- **Windows:** Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

Verify it worked:

```bash
node --version
```

You should see `v18.0.0` or higher.

### Step 2. Install Sipcode globally

```bash
npm i -g sipcode
```

This downloads Sipcode from npm and makes the `sipcode` command available everywhere.

If you see permission errors on Mac or Linux, try:

```bash
sudo npm i -g sipcode
```

Verify it installed:

```bash
sipcode --version
```

You should see `1.6.20` or higher.

### Step 3. Run `sipcode init` to wire it into Claude Code

```bash
sipcode init
```

This command does four things:

1. Creates a small `.sipcode/manifest.md` file in your current project so Claude knows what your project is about
2. Adds a small block to your `CLAUDE.md` (or creates one) with rules that keep Claude's replies terse
3. Installs the Sipcode hook into Claude Code, which is the thing that actually saves tokens
4. Marks the date so `sipcode impact` can show you before-and-after savings later

You will see a checklist as it runs. Each step shows a checkmark when it completes.

**The two questions it asks** (and what to pick):

**1. Manifest budget.** How lean to keep the project summary Sipcode injects.
- **tighten** (recommended): auto-trims low-signal sections so the summary stays lean, and never blocks you.
- **strict**: hard-caps the manifest at 2k tokens and refuses if it would go over.
- **off**: no cap, the manifest can grow to any size.

**2. Output compression rules.** How terse Claude's replies are in this project.
- **default** (recommended): diff-style edits, no "here's what I did" preamble.
- **strict**: telegraphic, clipped replies, for power users who want maximum brevity.
- **verbose**: extra context and explanation, good while you are still learning the tool.
- **skip**: don't install reply rules at all.

Not sure? Take the recommended option in each. You can change either choice later: run `sipcode rules --mode <default|strict|verbose>` for the reply style, or re-run `sipcode manifest` to regenerate the summary.

### Step 4. Open a new Claude Code session

Sipcode picks up automatically on the next tool call Claude makes. No restart needed in most cases. To be safe, you can close any existing Claude Code window and open a fresh one.

Now Claude Code will be using Sipcode in the background.

### Step 5. After about an hour of work, check it

```bash
sipcode drift
sipcode proxy --stats
```

If drift says "no drift" and proxy --stats shows a few dozen rewrites with savings, everything is working.

## Updating Sipcode

Sipcode never checks for updates on its own. That would require a network call, and zero network calls in normal use is a guaranteed property of the codebase (a test fails the build otherwise). Updating is always a manual, explicit step.

To update to the latest version:

```bash
npm i -g sipcode@latest
```

Or use the built-in helper:

```bash
sipcode update          # prints your current version + the update command
sipcode update --run    # runs the update in place for you
```

After updating, confirm with `sipcode --version` and see what changed in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md). The MCP config never needs re-pasting; Claude asks the server for its tools on every reconnect, so new tools appear automatically.

**Release cadence:** patch releases ship whenever a fix or improvement is ready, often within a day or two of a reported issue. Since Sipcode can't notify you (zero network calls), a good habit is to run `sipcode update` about once a week. It's a one-second check, and `--run` upgrades you on the spot if something's new. Watch or star the [repo](https://github.com/Anuj7411/sipcode) to catch releases too.

## Frequently asked questions

### Is it really free?

Yes. MIT license. No tracking. No telemetry sent to us. No paid tier. You can read every line of source code on GitHub.

### Does it send my code anywhere?

No. Sipcode makes zero network calls during normal use. Everything runs locally on your machine. We have a privacy test that fails if any network code is imported into the source.

### How is it different from other context tools?

See the [comparison page](https://anuj7411.github.io/sipcode/compare/). The short version: Sipcode is the only one with a published reproducible benchmark, zero false-dedup by architecture, and mid-session install support.

### What is "context rot"?

When Claude's context window fills up with stale, repeated, or off-topic information, the quality of its answers drops. Sipcode measures this with `sipcode drift` and removes most of the waste with the proxy hook.

### Does it work with Cursor or other AI tools?

Today, only with Claude Code (since Claude Code is the only tool that exposes the hooks Sipcode needs). Support for other CLIs is something we are exploring.

### How do I update?

```bash
npm i -g sipcode@latest
```

Or run `sipcode update` to see your version and the command, or `sipcode update --run` to update in place. Sipcode never auto-checks for updates (zero network calls), so updating is always explicit. See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed.

### How do I uninstall?

```bash
sipcode proxy --uninstall
npm uninstall -g sipcode
```

| `sipcode receipt` | Generate a shareable PNG receipt of a session |

Run any of them with `--help` for full options.

**Tip: which sessions do these report on?** By default, `why`, `stats`, `today`, `forecast`, `trend`, and `impact` look across **all** your projects, not just the folder you are standing in. So if you run `sipcode why` inside project A but project B had the most recent activity, you will see project B. To scope any of them to the project you are currently in, add `--here` (for example, `sipcode why --here` or `sipcode today --here`). Use `sipcode why --list` to see every session and pick a specific one with `--session <id>`.
