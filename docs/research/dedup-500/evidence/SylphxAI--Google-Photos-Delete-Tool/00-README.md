# Google Photos Delete Tool – Duplicate Finder & Bulk Delete

Google Photos Delete Tool finds and deletes duplicate photos in Google Photos,
and bulk deletes safely: dry run first, batches of up to 500, optional empty
trash. Made by [Sylphx](https://sylphx.com).

Get it on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-photos-delete-tool/jiahfbbfpacpolomdjlpdpiljllcdenb)
or as a userscript. It runs in your browser; nothing is uploaded.

## Find duplicates

Google Photos only removes exact copies of the same file. Copies that were
resized, re-saved, edited slightly, or uploaded twice from different apps
stay in your library. **Find duplicates** finds them for you:

1. Open the view you want to check (your library, an album, or a search).
2. Click the extension icon, then **Find duplicates** (userscript: the
   **Find duplicates** button in the floating panel), then **Scan this view**.
3. The tool scrolls the view and compares small thumbnails on your computer.
   Look-alike photos are shown in groups.
4. In each group the best copy is kept (green) and the rest are marked for
   Trash (red). The best copy is the largest one when the size is known,
   otherwise the oldest. Click any photo to switch it. Each group always
   keeps at least one photo.
5. Use the **Similarity** slider: 95% finds near-identical copies; lower
   values also group edits and burst shots, so check those groups.
6. **Preview (dry run)** checks the chosen photos are still in the view
   without changing anything. **Move to Trash** hands them to the same safe
   delete flow as the rest of the tool: a one-time confirmation, batches,
   Stop at any time, and 60 days in Trash to change your mind.
7. **Pro review tools** (free review is unchanged; see [Pro](#pro)) save time on
   big libraries: a keep rule for every group at once, auto-accept for
   near-identical groups, and a CSV export of the groups.

![Find duplicates reviewing look-alike groups on a test page](docs/images/find-duplicates.png)

*Test page with generated images, not real photos
([`scripts/dupes-demo.mjs`](scripts/dupes-demo.mjs)).*

**Private by design.** Thumbnails are fetched only from Google's own image
servers (the same ones the page already uses), turned into a 64-bit
fingerprint in memory, and forgotten when you close the review. Nothing is
uploaded; there is no server. Works for tens of thousands of photos: the
comparison runs in short slices so the tab stays responsive, with progress
and Cancel throughout. Large views take a while because Google Photos loads
the grid only as you scroll.

**Why not the Google Photos API?** Since 31 March 2025 Google no longer lets
apps read your whole library through the Photos API, so an external
duplicate finder cannot scan your whole library. This tool works inside the Google
Photos page you already have open instead.

## Bulk delete

Google Photos has no "delete all". This tool runs the select, trash, confirm
loop for you in batches of up to 500 until your current view is empty. It works
in your browser by clicking the same controls a person would, because the
Google Photos Library API has no delete endpoint.

## Two surfaces, one engine

| Surface | Get it | Includes |
|---|---|---|
| **Chrome / Firefox extension** | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-photos-delete-tool/jiahfbbfpacpolomdjlpdpiljllcdenb) listing; Firefox: zip on each GitHub release, loaded manually (no AMO listing yet); no Edge listing | Popup UI, badge, 10 languages, empty-trash flow |
| **Userscript** (Tampermonkey, Violentmonkey, Greasemonkey) | `google-photos-delete.user.js` from the latest release | Same engine, floating panel, same safety model |

## Built to be trusted

- **Fail-closed matching.** Delete, confirm and empty-trash buttons are matched
  by positive multilingual keywords on `aria-label`, tooltip or text. An unknown
  UI stops the run with an error; it never clicks a guess.
- **Consent gate.** The first real run asks you to acknowledge what will
  happen. Nothing is scheduled or unattended.
- **60-day Trash.** Deleted photos sit in Google Photos Trash for 60 days.
  "Empty trash afterwards" is opt-in, permanent, and reported `done` only after
  the trash is verified empty.
- **Accurate numbers.** The progress bar is indeterminate while the total is
  unknown; ETA appears once a dry run has established a total.
- **No telemetry, no server.** Everything runs in your browser. Pro licence
  verification is local (Ed25519).

## Features

- **Find duplicates:** scan the current view, group look-alike photos by
  perceptual hash at an adjustable similarity, review which to keep, then move
  the rest to Trash through the consent-gated flow. Pro adds keep rules,
  auto-accept for confident groups and a CSV export of the groups.
- **Batch delete:** up to 500 per batch (Google's selection cap); the engine
  detects the cap, scrolls and flushes the final partial batch.
- **Pause / Resume / Stop:** stop is instant; a stopped run never reports a
  false error.
- **Dry run:** scrolls and counts without clicking anything, and (with Pro)
  returns a per-type breakdown.
- **Empty trash (opt-in):** opens `/trash`, empties it and verifies the result.
- **Type filters (Pro):** delete only screenshots, videos, animations, collages
  or photos.
- **Date filter (Pro):** delete only items before a date, after a date, or
  between two dates, optionally combined with a type.
- **Versioned selector packs:** Google Photos selectors and keyword lists live
  in a versioned JSON pack, so a UI change ships as a data patch.
- **Report issue:** one click opens a pre-filled GitHub issue with pack version,
  selector matches and observed labels.
- **10 languages** in the extension UI, with compile-time-complete translations.

## Installation

### Chrome / Firefox

1. Chrome: install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-photos-delete-tool/jiahfbbfpacpolomdjlpdpiljllcdenb).
   Firefox: there is no Firefox Add-ons (AMO) listing yet, so download the
   Firefox zip from the latest GitHub release and load it manually (below).
2. Navigate to [photos.google.com](https://photos.google.com/?hl=en).
3. Click the extension icon, confirm the safety notice on your first real
   run, then press **Start**.

Manual load (development): download the release zip, unzip, open
`chrome://extensions` (or `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, then Load Temporary Add-on), enable
developer mode, and **Load unpacked**.

### Userscript

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or
   [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).
2. Install the latest
   [`google-photos-delete.user.js`](https://github.com/SylphxAI/Google-Photos-Delete-Tool/releases/latest/download/google-photos-delete.user.js).
3. Open [photos.google.com](https://photos.google.com/?hl=en) — the
   floating panel appears bottom-right.

## Usage

1. Be on the Google Photos view you intend to clean (the tool acts on the
   current view).
2. **Dry run** first to see the count without touching anything.
3. Configure: photos per batch (default 500), empty-trash toggle, optional
   type filter and date filter (Pro). To clean one album, open that album
   first: the tool acts on the current view, so albums work for free.
4. **Start**, and use **Pause / Resume / Stop** freely. Stop is immediate.
5. Watch the progress: deleted count, rate, elapsed; ETA only when a
   dry-run total is known.

## Privacy

Zero data collection, zero servers, zero telemetry. Full statement in
[`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md).

## Pro

Deleting stays free forever: the delete engine, dry-run and empty-trash cost
nothing. **Pro** adds the analysis layer on top:

- **Type filters** - clean up only screenshots, videos, photos, animations or
  collages.
- **Date filter** - delete only items before a date, after a date, or between
  two dates (the end days are included). It reads each tile's date from its
  label ("2 Jan 2020", "Mar 3, 2024", "10 mars 2012", "2020-01-01"; English and
  French month names) and never guesses: a tile whose date cannot be read is
  skipped, and the dry run says how many ("N items skipped: date not
  readable"). "Before" and "after" exclude the date you pick. It combines with
  the type filter: both must match.
- **Saved cleanup presets** - save the current filter setup (type, date mode and
  dates, plus an optional note of the view you were on, such as an album) under
  a name, up to 20, then apply, rename or delete it. Applying a preset only
  fills the controls: you still press Start, the dry run still works and the
  consent step is still required. A preset never runs by itself (no timers, no
  background runs), and if its saved view differs from the page you are on it
  only shows the address as a hint; it never navigates. Presets live on your
  device (extension storage, or the userscript's local storage).
- **Duplicate review tools** - for big libraries, in Find duplicates:
  - **Keep rule** - keep the newest or the oldest copy
    in every group at once (instead of the default best copy). A rule needs
    the data it uses: where a group has no readable date, that group
    keeps the default pick and the tool tells you how many did. Ties also fall
    back to the default pick. Every group still keeps exactly one photo you can
    change.
  - **Auto-accept confident groups** - groups where every photo is 98% or more
    similar are pre-approved. The groups below 98% come as one combined list;
    each moves to Trash only after you approve it (or approve all). You still
    press **Move to Trash** and confirm as before.
  - **Export CSV** - the groups as `group_id,item_id,decision,similarity`
    (kept or trashed), downloaded on your device. No network call.

  Free users see these controls disabled with a **Pro** link and keep the
  complete default review: all groups, the best copy kept, flip any photo,
  preview, Trash.
- **Dry-run report and export** - see exactly what a run would remove, and
  export it as CSV before you commit.

### Release gate

Every release passes the live-run protocol in
[`docs/RELEASE_GATE.md`](docs/RELEASE_GATE.md): a disposable account, a fixed
deletion scenario, and recorded postconditions. Release notes carry the
evidence.

## FAQ

**Is this safe?** It only clicks what a human would click, matching
destructive actions by positive keywords (never guessing), and deleted
photos sit in Trash for 60 days. The only permanent action is "Empty
trash", which is opt-in, gated by the postcondition check, and never
unattended.

**What happens when Google changes their UI?** The selector pack version
is recorded in every diagnostic report. When a drift is reported, the fix
is a data patch to the pack, shipped as a point release. This is the
maintenance model by design.

**How does it decide what is a duplicate?** Each thumbnail is shrunk to
32×32 gray pixels and turned into a 64-bit perceptual hash (pHash). Two
photos whose hashes differ in only a few bits look the same to a person.
The default 95% similarity allows 3 of 64 bits to differ. The hashing and
grouping are ported from our Photo Dedup engine and tested against its
reference results.

**Does it find duplicates across my whole library?** It checks the view you
scan. Scan your main Photos view to cover the library, or an album or
search to narrow it down.

**How fast is it?** Deletion runs at Google's UI pace; each release's photos per
minute is measured in the release gate and published in its notes.

**What about the trash?** Deleted photos go to Trash for 60 days.
"Empty trash afterwards" empties and permanently removes them — with your
explicit opt-in.
