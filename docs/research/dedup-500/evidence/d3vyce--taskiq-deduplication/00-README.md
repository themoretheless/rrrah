# Taskiq Deduplication

Redis-backed deduplication middleware for Taskiq that prevents duplicate tasks from being queued or executed concurrently.

## Installation

```bash
uv add "taskiq-deduplication"
```

## Quick Start

```python
from taskiq_redis import ListQueueBroker
from taskiq_deduplication import RedisDeduplicationMiddleware, DuplicateTaskError

broker = ListQueueBroker("redis://localhost:6379").with_middlewares(
    RedisDeduplicationMiddleware(redis_url="redis://localhost:6379"),
)


@broker.task
async def send_report(user_id: int) -> None: ...


# First dispatch acquires the lock — succeeds.
await send_report.kiq(user_id=42)

# Second dispatch while the first is queued or running — raises.
try:
    await send_report.kiq(user_id=42)
except DuplicateTaskError:
    pass  # already queued or running
```

## Features

- **Sender-side deduplication** — rejects duplicate tasks at dispatch time via a Redis lock, before they reach the broker.
- **Handle to the winning task** — a rejected caller gets the winner's `task_id` on the error, so it can await the winner's result instead of re-kicking.
- **Atomic lock release** — lock is released on completion or error via a Lua check-and-delete; only the owning task can release its lock.
- **Configurable TTL** — set a global default or override per task with the `deduplication_ttl` label.
- **Lock heartbeat** — a background task re-extends the lock TTL while the task runs, so long-running tasks keep their lock instead of expiring mid-execution and admitting a duplicate.
- **Explicit lock key** — pin any task to a fixed Redis key with `deduplication_key`, bypassing fingerprint computation entirely.
- **Partial fingerprint** — deduplicate on a subset of kwargs with `deduplication_key_fields`, ignoring irrelevant arguments (positional arguments are excluded).
- **Per-task opt-out** — disable deduplication for individual tasks with the `deduplication` label.
- **Startup resilience** — automatic reconnection with exponential backoff if Redis is unavailable at broker startup.
- **Fail-open mode** — opt in with `fail_open` to keep dispatching tasks when Redis is unreachable at runtime, trading deduplication for availability.
