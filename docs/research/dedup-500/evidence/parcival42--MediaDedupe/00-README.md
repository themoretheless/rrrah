# MediaDedupe

Web-based duplicate finder for images & videos — perceptual hashing, ffmpeg-powered, with smart intro/outro detection and a parallel scan engine.

![Visual duplicates](docs/scan_visual.png)

## Features

- **Exact duplicates** — byte-identical files detected via MD5
- **Visual duplicates** — same image at different resolutions or compression levels, detected via perceptual hashing (pHash, configurable Hamming threshold)
- **Video duplicates** — frame sampling at 5 positions across the video timeline; optional intensive mode that also compares intro/outro blocks to catch re-encoded or trimmed copies
- **Two-directory comparison** — find files from directory A that are duplicates of files in directory B (useful for consolidating backups)
- **SQLite cache** — hashes are stored so repeat scans are near-instant for already-processed files
- **Web UI** — interactive browser interface with real-time scan progress, inline previews, and one-click deletion
- **CLI mode** — generates a self-contained HTML report, no server required
- **Multilingual UI** — German and English, switchable at runtime

## Supported formats

| Type | Extensions |
|---|---|
| Images | `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.png` `.gif` `.webp` `.bmp` `.tiff` `.tif` `.heic` `.heif` |
| Videos | `.mp4` `.mkv` `.avi` `.mov` `.m4v` `.webm` `.wmv` `.flv` |

HEIC/HEIF is Apple's image format used by default on iPhones and iPads. Support requires the optional `pillow-heif` package, which is included in `requirements.txt`. If you don't need HEIC support you can skip it (`pip install Pillow imagehash`). Video scanning requires `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`.

## Quick start

### Docker (recommended)

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  mediadedupe:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/media:/media
      - /path/to/data:/data        # database & working files
    command: ["-d", "/media"]
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - AUTH_SECRET=a_long_random_secret_string
```

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. On first open you will be prompted to create an account — see [First-run setup](#first-run-setup).

### Python (web UI)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# ffmpeg must be available in PATH for video scanning

python app.py -d /path/to/your/media
python app.py -d /path/to/your/media --port 8080 --host 0.0.0.0  # default port
```

### Python (CLI — HTML report only)

```bash
pip install Pillow imagehash pillow-heif   # pillow-heif optional

python cli.py -d /path/to/your/media -t images
python cli.py -d /path/to/your/media -t videos
python cli.py -d /path/to/your/media -t both -o my_report.html --workers 8
```

The report is written to the working directory (`$DUPFINDER_DATA`, default `/tmp/mediadedupe/`).

## Configuration

| Environment variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_SECRET` | *(random)* | HMAC key for session cookies. Set a fixed value so sessions survive restarts. |
| `DUPFINDER_DATA` | `/tmp/mediadedupe` | Directory for the SQLite database and HTML reports. Set this via the `volumes` mount in docker-compose. |

## First-run setup

![Initial Setup](docs/Setup_en.png)

When you open the web UI for the first time, you will be redirected to a setup page where you create the **first account** (username + password). This account is created once — the setup page is only accessible as long as no user exists in the database. All accounts have equal access.

After the initial setup, log in with those credentials. Additional accounts can be managed from within the app. Sessions are valid for 30 days and are signed with `AUTH_SECRET` (set a fixed value via the environment variable so sessions survive restarts).

## Language / Localization

The web UI is available in **German** and **English**. The language can be switched at any time via the language selector at the bottom of the sidebar — no restart required. All UI labels, messages, and scan log output switch instantly.

The CLI report (`cli.py`) is rendered in English.

## Scan settings (web UI)

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Media type** | Images, videos, or both |
| **Compare mode** | Enable a second directory to find cross-directory duplicates |
| **pHash threshold** | Hamming distance for visual image matching (0 = pixel-identical, ≤ 8 recommended) |
| **Frame threshold** | Hamming distance per video frame (default 10) |
| **Min frame matches** | How many of the 5 sampled frames must match (default 4) |
| **Duration tolerance** | Videos whose durations differ by more than this (seconds) are never compared |
| **Intensive mode** | Samples the first and last N seconds of each video (default: 30 s at 1 fps) and performs all-pairs frame matching on those blocks. Catches re-encoded or slightly trimmed copies that share identical intros/outros. Only available in **Videos** mode. |
| **Workers** | Parallel threads for hashing (default: up to 4, auto-detected) |

**Compare mode** scans two directories independently and then finds files in directory A that are duplicates of files in directory B. Only cross-directory pairs are shown — within-directory duplicates are not reported in this mode. Useful for backup consolidation: point A at your current library and B at the backup to see which files already exist in both places.

To set the two paths, enable the *Compare mode* checkbox in the scan form. A small **"Tree click sets: Dir 1 / Dir 2"** selector appears at the bottom of the directory tree. Select which target should receive the next click, then navigate the tree — the chosen path is written into the corresponding input field. Dir 1 is highlighted in blue, Dir 2 in red.

**Intensive mode** increases scan time noticeably for large video libraries. Enable it when a regular scan misses near-duplicate videos that differ only in encoding or slight trimming at the start or end.
