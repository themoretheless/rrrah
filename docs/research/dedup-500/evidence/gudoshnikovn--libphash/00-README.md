# libphash

A high-performance, portable C library for Perceptual Image Hashing.

`libphash` is designed for speed and efficiency, providing a robust set of algorithms for image fingerprinting with native, SIMD-accelerated decoders and a zero-fragmentation memory model.

## Language Bindings

* **Python**: [python-libphash](https://github.com/gudoshnikovn/python-libphash) (`pip install python-libphash`)
* *More bindings (Node.js, Rust, Go) are in development.*

---

## Core Features

* **Multiple Algorithms**: `aHash`, `dHash`, `pHash` (DCT-based), `wHash` (Wavelet), `mHash`, `BMH`, `Radial`, and `ColorHash`.
* **High-Performance Decoders**: Built-in support for `libjpeg-turbo`, `libpng`, `spng`, and `libwebp` with SIMD acceleration (NEON/SSE) and `mmap` optimization.
* **Fast Grayscale Loading**: Native decoders can perform grayscale conversion during decompression, significantly reducing CPU cycles and memory overhead.
* **Zero-Fragmentation Arena**: Optimized context-based **Arena Allocator** for internal operations, ensuring predictable performance in high-load environments.
* **FFI-Friendly**: Clean C API with opaque pointers, designed for seamless integration with Python, Rust, Node.js, and Go.
* **Cross-Platform**: Optimized for ARM64 (Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi) and x86_64.

## Performance Modes

`libphash` can be built in two primary configurations:

| Mode | Decoders | Dependencies | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **High Performance** (Default) | `libjpeg-turbo`, `libpng`/`spng`, `libwebp` | Self-contained (vendor submodules) | Production, massive datasets, server-side processing |
| **Minimal** | `stb_image` (fallback) | Zero | Embedded systems, quick scripts, simple builds |

## Building & Installation

### Recommended (CMake)

Best for managing bundled high-performance decoders and system integration.

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install

```

### Portable (Makefile)

Fast and simple for minimal builds or static linking.

```bash
# Build static library
make -j8

# Run tests
make test

```

---

## Usage Example

### C Code

```c
#include <libphash.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    ph_context_t *ctx = NULL;
    uint64_t hash = 0;

    ph_create(&ctx);
    
    // Enable fast grayscale loading (skips RGB conversion)
    ph_context_set_load_grayscale(ctx, 1);
    
    if (ph_load_from_file(ctx, "photo.jpg") == PH_SUCCESS) {
        ph_compute_phash(ctx, &hash);
        printf("pHash: %016llx\n", (unsigned long long)hash);
    }

    ph_free(ctx);
    return 0;
}

```

### Compiling & Linking

To compile your application with `libphash`:

```bash
gcc main.c -o my_app -lphash

```
