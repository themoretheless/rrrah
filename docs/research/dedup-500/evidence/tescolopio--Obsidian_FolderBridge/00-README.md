# Folder Bridge

Extends Obsidian's single-root vault by letting you mount external folders as seamless, native-feeling directories inside your vault. Files stay in their original locations — no copying, no duplicating, no symlinking required.

---

## Current Release: 2.15.4

[2.15.4](https://github.com/tescolopio/Obsidian_FolderBridge/releases/tag/2.15.4), published September 20, 2026, is a maintenance release. Pull-request, main-branch, and release builds now share the complete `npm run validate` gate. Plugin behavior and dependencies are unchanged from 2.15.3.

The included 2.15.3 improvements cover mounted-file refresh and cached reads, Windows/WSL path handling, watcher suppression transitions, local startup metadata batching, explorer integration, device-specific paths, and managed TOC controls. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for the complete release history.

**Prerelease for testing:** [2.15.5-rc.4](https://github.com/tescolopio/Obsidian_FolderBridge/releases/tag/2.15.5-rc.4) is the opt-in SFTP identity-verification candidate, not a stable promotion. Existing unpinned SFTP mounts now require independently verified fingerprint approval before authentication; changed keys are refused. Approval is outside bounded network/authentication deadlines. It retains rc.3's override-preservation and remote-root trash-dialog fixes, rc.2's recoverable local trash, remote-trash refusal, append safety and path hardening, plus rc.1's Android-loading and suppressed-startup fixes. Native confirmation remains pending; WebDAV remains unavailable on Android.

**Candidate limitations:** use a disposable vault and copied sources. Local
trash uses a separate recovery folder per deletion. Native SFTP trust validation,
S3 prefix/copy fixes, the non-C whole-drive ancestor policy, dependency advisories
and native validation remain unresolved. The [release outline](docs/NEXT_RELEASE.md)
and [rc.4 notes](CHANGELOG.md#2155-rc4---2026-10-03) distinguish included changes
from those remaining gates. Existing root-deletion preferences are preserved;
review that setting if a failed rc.2 remote-trash attempt changed your choice.
Stable 2.15.4 remains latest.

**Local development candidate:** unpublished 2.15.5-rc.5 adds the combined S3
prefix/copy-source corrections on top of all rc.4 fixes. It is not available in
the rc.4 release assets. Existing doubled-prefix objects are not automatically
migrated or deleted; inspect the bucket before resuming writes. See the
[Windows cumulative test checklist](docs/WINDOWS_TEST_CHECKLIST.md).

**Validation limits (stable 2.15.4):** the release passed 400 automated tests across 13 files, plus lint, UI text checks, typechecking, and the production build. The full native Windows/WSL, macOS, Android, and current/oldest Obsidian host checks remain incomplete. Reporters confirmed two specific fixes on the earlier rc.2 build, not the complete 2.15.4 matrix. Automated tests do not establish native editor, Outline, metadata, or save compatibility. Back up your vault, settings, and mounted source folders; test writes on disposable copies. See the [release validation checklist](docs/RELEASE_VALIDATION.md).

## Full Feature List

**SFTP trust in 2.15.5-rc.4:** connections require explicit host-key
fingerprint approval before authentication; earlier prereleases do not include this behavior.
Existing unpinned mounts require approval after upgrading to rc.4.
Compare the displayed fingerprint with the server administrator
over a trusted channel. Changed keys are refused; forgetting a saved key is an
explicit edit saved in mount settings, not an automatic recovery action.
Key discovery uses a bounded connection without authentication. That connection
closes before approval, so comparing fingerprints is not limited by the SSH
handshake deadline. Authentication uses a fresh, bounded connection that must
present the same approved key; it cannot open another approval prompt.

### Core

- **Zero duplication** — files are always read and written from their real locations on disk or on the remote backend
- **Multi-root workspaces** — mount as many folders as you want at any virtual path inside one vault
- **Obsidian integration** — mounted files are exposed to the file explorer, Quick Switcher, Search, indexing workflows, and embeds; native editor, metadata, and save compatibility still require the checks linked above
- **Image and PDF rendering** — embedded images and PDFs inside mounted folders render correctly, including files served through data URIs or the local file server when Obsidian's normal vault URL scheme would fail
- **Security allowlist** — only explicitly approved real paths can be accessed; protected system directories are blocked
- **Dry-run mode** — log write operations without executing them when testing a new setup

### Mount Types

- **Local folder mounts** — mount any directory from your local filesystem, external drive, NAS share, UNC path, or WSL-exposed folder
- **WebDAV mounts** — mount folders from Nextcloud, ownCloud, Synology, or any generic WebDAV server; credentials are encrypted per-device on desktop via the OS keychain and fall back to session memory on mobile
- **S3-compatible mounts** — mount Amazon S3, Backblaze B2, MinIO, Cloudflare R2, and other compatible buckets, with provider presets and per-device encrypted secrets on desktop
- **SFTP mounts** — mount remote SSH directories with password or private-key authentication, persistent reconnecting sessions, and desktop-only support
- **Vault-to-vault bridging** — mount content from another Obsidian vault; the other vault's config and conflict-prone folders such as `.obsidian`, `.trash`, and `.smart-connections` are auto-ignored

### Mount Management

- **Edit mounts in place** — change virtual path, real path, label, read-only mode, or watcher settings without deleting and recreating the mount
- **Drag-drop reordering in Settings** — reorder mounts visually and persist the order immediately
- **Drag-drop in the file explorer** — drag a mount root to a new location in the vault tree and update its virtual path live
- **`Move mount to…` context action** — right-click a mount root and choose a new parent from the vault folder picker
- **Read-only mounts** — block writes through a specific mount while keeping the content fully browsable and searchable
- **Fast read-only toggles** — toggle read-only from the Settings row or through assignable commands for one mount or all mounts
- **TOC config files** — load external read-only TOC files, bind the UI to a managed writable TOC file for local and vault mounts, and create that managed file directly from your current UI mounts

### Reliability and Conflict Resolution

- **Background health monitoring** — active mounts are probed every 30 seconds for reachability
- **Status bar indicators** — the status item surfaces mount health, including the unreachable warning state and all-clear state
- **One-click reconnect** — the conflict resolution UI exposes reconnect actions for mounts that have gone offline
- **WebDAV-specific health probing** — WebDAV mounts are checked through the adapter instead of local filesystem assumptions
- **Startup mount replay** — mounted folders are injected into Obsidian's internal vault tree without requiring a restart

### Per-Mount Watcher Tuning

- **Custom debounce** — set a debounce delay per mount to balance responsiveness against churn from rapid-save tools
- **Polling mode** — switch individual mounts to stat polling for network shares or filesystems without reliable native watch events
- **Polling interval** — configure polling cadence independently per mount
- **Max-files cap** — limit startup scan size for very large directory trees
- **Suppress all watcher events** — keep a mount visible while preventing later external file changes from triggering Obsidian/plugin reactions. Existing files are still indexed once when the mount loads, so other plugins may see one burst of create events at that moment
- **New file event filter** — optionally announce only Markdown files on create, reducing interference from attachment-rename plugins
- **Visible file-type filter** — expose all files, Markdown only, or PDF only while keeping the real folder structure intact on disk

### Sync and Multi-Device

- **Device-specific mount paths** — map the same virtual folder to different real paths on different machines
- **Per-device path overrides** — override a synced mount's real path locally without changing another device's configuration
- **Foreign mount control** — choose whether mounts created on another device are available on the current one
- **Sync-friendly settings model** — mount definitions can sync while real secrets stay device-specific and decrypted only on the originating desktop OS keychain

### Ignore System

- **Browse-to-ignore** — pick a subfolder from the OS folder picker and store its mount-relative path automatically
- **Path-relative ignore patterns** — entries containing `/` ignore a specific subtree without affecting similarly named folders elsewhere
- **Name patterns** — plain entries such as `.git` or `node_modules` match any leaf with that name
- **Glob patterns** — wildcard entries such as `*.tmp` and `~$*` match leaf names as globs
- **Context-menu ignore** — right-click any file or folder inside a mount and add it instantly to the ignore list
- **Global ignore rules** — apply a shared ignore baseline across every mount

### Platform and Performance

- **Windows path handling** — explicit handling for long paths, UNC/network paths, reserved names, and case-insensitive comparisons; native Windows/WSL validation remains pending
- **Linux and macOS support** — POSIX paths work natively, and the same core adapter and watcher logic applies across desktop platforms
- **Android remote-mount paths** — WebDAV and S3-compatible mount options have a mobile-adapted UI; packaged Android enablement and remote access remain pending native verification
- **Background file watcher** — file changes from mounted folders appear in Obsidian in real time when the backend supports it
- **PathMapper cache optimisation** — active mounts are pre-normalised and sorted once so path resolution stays fast even with many mounts

### Platform Support

Implementation and validation status for 2.15.4. For platform-specific caveats and setup notes, see [Platform Notes](#platform-notes) below. Historical reports are not a substitute for testing this release.

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Windows | Native validation pending | Path and WSL UNC regressions have automated coverage; native enable/open/restart checks remain pending. |
| macOS | Native validation pending | POSIX paths are implemented; ARM64 installation, file opening, and watcher checks remain pending. |
| Linux / WSL development | Automated checks passed | Ubuntu CI and development checks do not verify native Obsidian behavior or Windows-hosted WSL mounts. |
| Android | Native validation pending | The plugin failed to load on Android in 2.15.4 (#18); prerelease 2.15.5-rc.1 fixes the cause but is unconfirmed on a device. WebDAV mounts are unavailable on mobile in that build; S3/B2 is untested. See [Android Setup Guide](docs/ANDROID_SETUP.md). |
| iOS | Not supported | No verified iOS support. |

## Installation

Folder Bridge is not currently listed in Obsidian's Community Plugins directory. Use BRAT or manual installation below until the community submission is approved.

### Using BRAT (Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tool)

Install the latest published GitHub release via [BRAT](https://tfthacker.com/BRAT):

1. Install the **Obsidian42 - BRAT** plugin from the Community Plugins directory.
2. Enable BRAT in your settings.
3. Open the command palette and run **BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing**.
4. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/tescolopio/Obsidian_FolderBridge`
5. Click **Add Plugin**. BRAT will automatically download and install the latest release.

### Manual Installation

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/tescolopio/Obsidian_FolderBridge/releases/latest)
2. Copy them to `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/folderbridge/`
3. Enable the plugin in **Settings → Community Plugins**

### Local Development (git clone)

If you want to run straight from source (no release download needed):

```bash
# 1. Clone into your vault's plugin folder
git clone https://github.com/tescolopio/Obsidian_FolderBridge.git \
  /path/to/your-vault/.obsidian/plugins/folderbridge

cd /path/to/your-vault/.obsidian/plugins/folderbridge

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Build the plugin (produces main.js that Obsidian loads)
npm run build
```

Then in Obsidian: **Settings → Community Plugins → disable Safe Mode → enable Folder Bridge**.

> **Hot-reload during development:** run `npm run dev` instead of `npm run build`.
> Install the [hot-reload plugin](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) in Obsidian and it will
> automatically reload Folder Bridge whenever `main.js` is rebuilt.

---

## Quick Start

1. Click the **folder-plus** ribbon icon (or go to **Settings → Folder Bridge → Add Mount Point**)
2. Select the **Mount Type** (Local folder, WebDAV, S3/Backblaze B2, SFTP, or Another Obsidian vault)
3. Fill in the **Real path** and **Virtual path**, then click **Validate & Add**

The folder appears immediately in Obsidian's file explorer — no restart needed.

For full step-by-step instructions on each mount type and feature, see the [Usage Guide](#usage-guide) below.

For advanced JSON-driven mount definitions, see the [TOC Config Guide](docs/TOC_CONFIG.md).

If you want the Settings UI to write local and vault mounts into a JSON file instead of only `data.json`, use the managed TOC workflow described below.

---

## Mount Ownership and TOC Workflow

Folder Bridge now treats mount storage as a source-of-truth decision rather than just a file format option.

There are three mount ownership modes:

- **Manual / `data.json` mounts** — the default behavior when no managed TOC file is configured.
- **Managed TOC mounts** — local and vault mounts written by the Settings UI into one writable JSON file.
- **External TOC mounts** — additional JSON files that Folder Bridge reads at runtime but does not edit from the UI.

How it works in practice:

- If you do nothing, mounts keep working the old way and stay in `data.json`.
- If you configure a **Managed TOC file**, new local and vault mounts created from Settings are written there instead.
- If you already have a working local/vault setup in Settings, use **Create from current UI mounts** once to create the file and migrate those mounts automatically.
- If you add **External TOC config files**, those mounts appear in Settings but stay read-only because their source file is authoritative.
- WebDAV, S3, and SFTP mounts stay in `data.json` because TOC files do not store credentials.

This affects the whole plugin, not just the TOC screens:

- Editable mounts include manual mounts and managed-TOC mounts.
- Read-only external TOC mounts are locked consistently in row actions, ignore-list editing, toggle flows, and command-palette actions.
- Import/export covers mounts you can still manage from the UI.

Recommended setup:

1. Use **Managed TOC file** if you want one editable JSON source for local and vault mounts.
2. Use **Create from current UI mounts** the first time if your setup already exists in Settings.
3. Use **External TOC config files** for shared, reviewed, or machine-specific read-only mount definitions.
4. Leave credentialed cloud mounts in `data.json`.

For the JSON schema, examples, and troubleshooting details, see the [TOC Config Guide](docs/TOC_CONFIG.md).

## Usage Guide

### Adding a Local Mount

1. Click the **folder-plus** ribbon icon, or go to **Settings → Folder Bridge** and click **Add Mount Point**
2. In the **Mount Type** dropdown, select **Local folder**
3. **Real path** — click **Browse…** to open the OS folder picker, or type the absolute path  
   - Windows: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Work`  
   - Linux / macOS: `/home/yourname/Documents/Work`  
   - WSL path from Windows: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\yourname\Work`  
   - UNC network path: `\\server\share\documents`
4. **Virtual path** — where the folder will appear inside your vault, e.g. `Projects/Work`  
   - Click **Browse vault…** to pick an existing vault folder as the parent  
   - Leave empty to mount at vault root using the real folder's name
5. Optionally set a **Label** for the mount (shown in the settings list)
6. Optionally enable **Read-only** to block all writes through this mount
7. Click **Validate & Add**

The folder appears immediately in Obsidian's file explorer. No restart needed.

---

### Adding a WebDAV Mount

Mount a remote Nextcloud, ownCloud, or generic WebDAV server as a vault folder.

1. Click **Add Mount Point** and select **WebDAV server** in the **Mount Type** dropdown
2. **Server URL** — the full URL to your WebDAV server, e.g.:
   - Nextcloud: `https://cloud.example.com/remote.php/dav/files/username`
   - Generic: `https://dav.example.com`
3. **Remote path** — the path on the server to mount, e.g. `/Documents/Notes`
4. **Virtual path** — where it will appear in your vault, e.g. `Remote/Notes`
5. **Username** — your WebDAV username
6. **Password** — your WebDAV password  
   > 🔒 The password is encrypted with your **OS keychain** (Windows DPAPI / macOS Keychain / Linux libsecret) and stored in `data.json`. It persists across Obsidian restarts — no re-entry needed. The encrypted blob is device-specific; other devices cannot decrypt it even if `data.json` syncs. On mobile, passwords fall back to session memory only.
7. Click **Validate & Add**

Folder Bridge will test the connection before saving. If the server is unreachable, you'll see an error with the reason.

---

### Vault-to-Vault Bridging

Browse a folder from a second Obsidian vault inside your current one without duplicating files.

1. Click **Add Mount Point** and select **Another Obsidian vault** in the **Mount Type** dropdown
2. **Real path** — click **Browse…** and navigate to the **root folder** of the other vault (the folder that contains the `.obsidian` directory)
3. Optionally narrow to a **sub-folder** of that vault by specifying a relative path inside it
4. Set a **Virtual path** where it will appear in your current vault, e.g. `Reference`
5. Click **Validate & Add**

Folder Bridge automatically adds `.obsidian`, `.trash`, and `.smart-connections` to the ignore list for vault mounts to prevent the two vaults from interfering with each other.

---

### Editing an Existing Mount

All mount settings can be changed without deleting and re-adding the mount.

1. Open **Settings → Folder Bridge**
2. Click the **Edit** (pencil) button on any mount row
3. Change any field — virtual path, real path, label, read-only flag, or watcher settings
4. Click **Save**

The vault tree, file watcher, and all internal caches update live. No restart needed.

---

### Reordering Mounts

The order of mounts in the list determines the order they are checked during path resolution.

- **Drag** a mount row up or down in **Settings → Folder Bridge** to reorder it
- The new order is saved immediately

---

### Moving a Mount in the File Explorer

You can change a mount's virtual path directly from Obsidian's file explorer without opening Settings.

**Option 1 — Drag and drop:**
1. In the file explorer, click and hold the mounted folder
2. Drag it to a new location in the vault hierarchy
3. The virtual path updates live — nothing on disk is touched

**Option 2 — Context menu:**
1. Right-click the mounted folder root in the file explorer
2. Select **Move mount to…**
3. Choose a new parent folder from the vault picker
4. Click **Move**

---

### Read-Only Mounts

Prevent any write operations through a specific mount (useful for reference folders or shared network drives you don't own).

- Enable the **Read-only** toggle when adding or editing a mount, or click the **lock icon** directly on any mount row in Settings
- The lock icon turns amber when a mount is read-only so you can see its state at a glance without opening the edit modal
- Toggle all mounts at once with the **Folder Bridge: Toggle read-only on all mounts** command (assignable to a hotkey)
- Toggle a single mount by name with the **Folder Bridge: Toggle read-only on a specific mount…** command (assignable to a hotkey)
- Obsidian can still open, search, and read all files in the mount
- Any attempt to create, edit, rename, or delete a file through the mount is silently blocked with a one-time Notice

---

### Ignore List

Hide specific files or folders inside a mount from Obsidian. Useful for large directories (`node_modules`, build outputs) that would slow down indexing.

**Adding entries manually:**
1. Open **Settings → Folder Bridge**, expand the mount, and go to the **Ignore List** section
2. Type a pattern and click **Add**

**Adding entries with the folder picker (Browse…):**
1. Click the **Browse…** button next to the ignore list input
2. The OS folder picker opens inside the mount's real directory
3. Navigate to the subfolder you want to ignore and click **OK**
4. The mount-relative path is filled in automatically — review it and click **Add**

**Adding entries from the file explorer:**
1. Right-click any file or folder inside a mounted directory
2. Select **Ignore in Folder Bridge**
3. The entry is added immediately and the item disappears from the file explorer

**Pattern types:**

| Pattern | Behaviour | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Plain name | Matches any file or folder with that leaf name anywhere in the mount | `node_modules` |
| Path prefix (contains `/`) | Matches only that exact subtree | `assets/vendor/plantuml-stdlib` |
| Glob (contains `*`) | Matches leaf names against the glob | `*.tmp`, `~$*`, `build*` |

---

### Conflict Resolution & Health Monitoring

Folder Bridge checks every active mount for reachability every **30 seconds** in the background.

**When a mount goes offline** (drive disconnected, network drop, WebDAV server unreachable):
- An **orange indicator** appears in the Obsidian status bar
- Click the indicator to open the **Conflict Resolution panel**
- The panel shows every affected mount with its last-known error
- Click **Reconnect** next to a mount to retry it immediately

**When all mounts are reachable:**
- The status bar indicator turns **green** (if visible) or disappears, depending on your settings

---

### Per-Mount Watcher Tuning

Each mount has independent file-watcher settings. Open **Edit** on any mount to see:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Debounce (ms)** | 300 | How long to wait after the last file-change event before notifying Obsidian. Lower = more responsive; higher = less CPU on rapid saves. |
| **Use polling** | Off | Enable stat-based polling instead of native OS watch events. Required for most network drives and some containerised filesystems. |
| **Polling interval (ms)** | 2000 | How frequently to poll when polling mode is on. Has no effect when polling is off. |
| **Visible file types** | All | Limit what Obsidian sees from this mount: all files, Markdown only, or PDF only. |
| **Max files** | 10 000 | Stop scanning a directory tree after this many entries. Protects performance on very large mounts. |

> **Tip:** For a local SSD, leave all defaults. For a Samba/NFS network share, enable **Use polling** and set the interval to 3000–5000 ms to avoid hammering the server.

---

### Device-Specific Paths (Multi-Device Sync)

Each mount is tagged with the `deviceId` of the machine that created it. When your vault syncs to another device, that device's Obsidian will see the mount but won't activate it unless the path also exists there.

**To map a mount to a different path on another device:**

1. On the second device, open **Settings → Folder Bridge**
2. Find the mount (it will show a warning badge if the original path doesn't exist locally)
3. Click **Override Path** and enter the correct local path for this device
4. Click **Save**

The override applies only to this device; the original path is preserved for the device that created it.

**To let all mounts from other devices activate automatically (if paths match):**
- Enable **Allow foreign mounts** in **Settings → Folder Bridge**

---

## Settings Reference

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dry-run mode** | Log all write operations to the console without executing them. Safe for testing configuration changes. |
| **Show status bar item** | Display the active mount count (and health indicator) in Obsidian's status bar. |
| **Allow foreign mounts** | Activate mounts created on other devices if the real path exists on this machine. |
| **Mount list** | Enable, disable, edit, or remove individual mounts. Each row shows a live reachability badge and drag handle. |

---

## Platform Notes

### Windows

- **Long paths**: Paths over 260 characters are handled automatically with the `\\?\` prefix. For best results, also enable **Long Path Support** in Windows Settings → System → For Developers.
- **Symlinks**: Creating symlinks on Windows requires either Developer Mode or administrator rights. Folder Bridge itself does not create symlinks, but the underlying filesystem may encounter related permission errors.
- **UNC network paths** (`\\server\share\...`): Supported, but file-change watching may not work on some servers and the path may be unavailable offline.
- **Reserved names**: Files and folders named `CON`, `NUL`, `COM1`–`COM9`, `LPT1`–`LPT9` (Windows reserved device names) are blocked from creation via Folder Bridge to prevent cryptic OS errors.
- **OneDrive Files On Demand**: Online-only placeholder files will show a user-friendly error rather than a raw ENOENT. Right-click the file in Explorer and choose **Always keep on this device** to make it locally accessible.

### macOS

> ⚠️ **macOS has not yet been officially tested.** The POSIX code paths are fully implemented and should work, but there may be edge cases. If you run into issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/tescolopio/Obsidian_FolderBridge/issues) — macOS bug reports are actively welcomed.

- Standard absolute paths work: `/Users/yourname/Documents/Work`
- **iCloud Drive (optimized storage)**: Files set to "online only" behave like OneDrive placeholders — Folder Bridge will surface a friendly error. Open Finder, right-click the file, and choose **Download Now** to make it available locally.

### Mobile (iOS / Android)

**Android** — WebDAV and S3/B2 are the intended mobile mount types, but packaged enablement, remote access, and restart behavior still need native confirmation. The loading report in [#18](https://github.com/tescolopio/Obsidian_FolderBridge/issues/18) remains open. Local and SFTP mounts are unavailable on Android. See the [Android Setup Guide](docs/ANDROID_SETUP.md) for setup and testing instructions.

**iOS** — Not yet tested. WebDAV may work in theory (same code paths as Android) but is not officially supported. Feedback welcome via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tescolopio/Obsidian_FolderBridge/issues).

---

## Architecture

Folder Bridge installs a lightweight **virtual filesystem adapter shim** that intercepts every I/O call Obsidian makes to its vault:

```
Obsidian → vault.adapter (Proxy) → VirtualAdapter
                                        ├── path inside a mount? → Node.js fs APIs (real path)
                                        └── path outside mounts? → original FileSystemAdapter
```

A JavaScript `Proxy` forwards methods not handled by the virtual adapter to the original adapter. Integration also depends on private Obsidian behavior, so compatibility must be checked against the host versions in the release validation checklist.
